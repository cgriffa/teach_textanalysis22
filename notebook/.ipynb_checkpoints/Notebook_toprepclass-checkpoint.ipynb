Across advanced economies, the current inflation spike is proving to be broader and more persistent than initially expected, leading central banks to reassess the risk that it could become entrenched. This is no easy task, especially in the euro area.  Economic conditions in the euro area have benefited from the strong response of monetary policy and its positive interactions with fiscal policy during the pandemic. But this is not a typical business cycle, and we are not seeing a typical recovery.  The current inflation spike is for the most part not being driven by domestic factors – by an economy that is “running hot”, in other words. Demand remains below its pre-crisis trend.  Instead, the economy is experiencing a series of imported supply shocks that are pushing up inflation and depressing demand. The exit from the pandemic is characterised by global mismatches between demand and supply – in energy and goods markets in particular – with uneven effects across sectors.  As a result, past economic regularities may be a poor guide for the future.  This makes medium-term developments extremely hard to anticipate. There are forces at play that could delay the recovery and contain underlying price pressures, and others that could lead to accelerating inflation. Policy mistakes in either direction could push the economy onto an unfavourable path.  Faced with such uncertainty, there is a case for the central bank to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps in adjusting policy, so as not to suffocate the as yet incomplete recovery.  If we are to durably escape the low inflation and low growth environment that has defined the past decade, we cannot afford to waste the progress we have made so far. In the spirit of William Brainard[1], we should take small steps in a dark room. The dramatic conflict in Ukraine is now weighing negatively on both supply and demand conditions, making uncertainty more acute and exacerbating risks to the medium-term inflation outlook on both sides. In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer. And the ECB stands ready to act to avoid any dislocation in financial markets that could stem from the war in Ukraine and to protect the transmission of monetary policy.  Inflation as an imported phenomenon The recent inflation data in the euro area do not make for easy reading. Headline inflation reached 5% in January and is expected to stay above 2% for the entire year, while core inflation is at 2.3%. Inflation pressures are becoming widespread (Chart 1).[2]  To determine how monetary policy should respond, we need to understand the drivers of this inflation spike. I have previously spoken about “good”, “bad” and “ugly” inflation in this context, and each of these has different implications for policy.[3]  In short, good inflation is driven by domestic demand and wages consistent with our target, which monetary policy should seek to nurture until that target is reached. Bad inflation instead reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices and depress economic activity, which monetary policy should look through. Ugly inflation – the worst type of inflation – is driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which monetary policy should immediately stamp out. Data indicate that bad inflation is still dominating in the euro area today.  Unlike in the United States, our economy is not experiencing excess domestic demand. Household nominal income has not recovered its pre-pandemic trend and households are saving more of their income than they did before the pandemic (Chart 2). Consumer spending and investment both remain well below their pre-crisis trends (Chart 3). Inflation is largely imported, reflecting global shocks to supply and demand that are spilling over to our economy through import prices (Chart 4, left panel).  Around 60% of inflation in January was energy, of which the euro area is a net importer (Chart 4, right panel). This is the consequence of the recent extraordinary increases in oil and gas prices (Chart 5, left panel). These in turn mainly reflect shocks that compress energy supply, rather than stronger aggregate demand (Chart 5, right panel). The rise in the cost of energy has further accelerated after the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Inflation is also being fuelled by the global shift in consumer spending from services to manufactured goods at a time when the pandemic has disrupted production. This has translated into global supply chain bottlenecks, high durable goods prices and strong pipeline pressures. This effect, which also represents a supply shock for the euro area, is now being reabsorbed, but at a different pace in different economies (Chart 6).  These global supply-driven increases in prices – above all energy and industrial goods, but also food – explain a good part of the currently high headline inflation (Chart 7, left panel).  In contrast, services inflation – the most domestic inflation component – has so far largely come from high-contact sectors (Chart 7, right panel). These sectors are experiencing frictions created by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and some of them (such as transport services) are also sensitive to energy prices.

Chart 7 Uncertain domestic inflation   Sources: Left panel: ECB and ECB staff calculations; right panel: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations. Note: The latest observations are for December 2021.    Uncertainty in the inflation outlook Imported supply shocks that underpin bad inflation increase the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook in two main ways.  First, energy-driven inflation acts as a “tax”[4] on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. This adds to the uncertainty around the growth outlook, making it harder to judge when the economy is likely to reach full capacity. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was seeing a bounceback after the slowdown created by the Omicron wave. But we were still some way short of returning to our pre-crisis GDP trend, across a range of possible estimates (Chart 8). In my view, GDP reaching the bottom end of this range would be the bare minimum needed to conclude that resources are fully utilised[5] – and current projections suggest that this will not happen until the middle of 2023.  The terms of trade tax from higher energy prices could further delay the return to that growth path. The heavier energy bill has already reduced household purchasing power by around 2% (Chart 9, left panel) and is negatively affecting consumer confidence (Chart 9, right panel). It is also eroding the financial buffers built up during the pandemic, especially for households with low incomes, reducing the degree to which dissaving can support consumption in the future (Chart 10). Second, prolonged imported price shocks make it harder to assess whether inflation is feeding into domestic price pressures. The fact that core inflation is increasing above 2% may initially seem to suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are accumulating. However, rising core inflation is partly due to higher energy prices, which are pushing up costs in almost all sectors (Chart 11). Similarly, industrial goods inflation may remain elevated in the near term due to higher input costs, but beyond that its dynamics are hard to predict. Inventory levels are starting to return to normal, which suggests that demand might have peaked. The memory of supply shortages might prompt firms to build precautionary stocks that initially prolong tensions but ultimately lead to excess inventories once bottlenecks ease. This would amplify the manufacturing cycle and the volatility of goods inflation.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now intensifying this uncertainty.  We face greater financial volatility in the short term. There is a risk of renewed market dislocations as investors anticipate the potential impact of sanctions and possible retaliatory actions. And these dislocations might be felt unevenly, threatening the smooth transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. But we also face greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the medium term. The higher energy prices triggered by the conflict in Ukraine point to a longer period of above-target inflation, while supply disruptions of raw materials and food could prove more persistent[6]. At the same time, these factors increase the terms of trade tax and depress economic confidence, aggravating downside risks to growth and further delaying the return to full capacity.

The path to price stability This uncertainty means the path to price stability is exposed to pitfalls on both sides. As imported inflation now looks set to last longer, we will need to see wages catch up sufficiently to avoid a further fall in purchasing power. If that does not happen, we might face an adverse scenario of a slower closure of the output gap and renewed disinflationary pressures once bad inflation subsides. However, we could be also confronted with an opposite, equally adverse scenario where high inflation proves to be so persistent that it destabilises inflation expectations. That could feed into wage negotiations and domestic price pressures, entrenching inflation above our target.  Whether the economy can avoid these risks and move along a stable path depends crucially on our policy response. In such a finely balanced situation, any errant policy measure could easily push the economy onto the wrong path and put at risk what we have achieved so far. If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery. But if we are too timid in the face of mounting signs that inflation is becoming a domestic process, we might inadvertently give the impression that we lack determination to secure price stability.  In both scenarios, we should not infer the medium-term inflation outlook from present inflation figures. We need to carefully assess the prospects for wage growth, productivity growth and inflation expectations. This requires us to cross-check forward-looking indicators with evidence of what we can observe in the real economy. So far, the labour market is not looking excessively tight, especially in comparison with other jurisdictions (Chart 12, left panel), and even a significant increase in wage growth would not put it much above trend productivity growth plus our inflation target (Chart 12, right panel).[7] Wage growth has remained moderate to date[8], perhaps reflecting workers’ concerns about job security, and the shock from the Ukraine conflict could prompt further caution. Different measures of inflation expectations also show no signs of de-anchoring on the upside (Charts 13 and 14).[9]  Therefore, the danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment. At the same time, I would like to see more evidence that improvements in labour markets are translating into wage growth consistent with our 2% target to be confident that the low-inflation scenario has fully disappeared. Indeed, a key conclusion of our strategy review was that, when coming out of a long period of low inflation, we should wait to see underlying inflation sufficiently advanced before adjusting policy, of which wages are a central component. And option-implied probabilities of tail events suggest that markets still see risks of eventually falling back into a too-low inflation regime.[10]  In the current situation, the task for the ECB is therefore twofold.  First, with the crisis in Ukraine raising uncertainty to unprecedented levels, our immediate priority is to protect the functioning of the financial sector and bolster confidence, in order to contain the impact of the shock on the economy and keep in place the conditions for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  Second, we should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps as the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer.

Note: Values were rounded to one decimal place prior to aggregation.    Accompanying the recovery with a light touch More than 40 years ago, William Brainard proposed the “conservatism principle”, which calls for cautious action when policymakers are faced with uncertainty.[11]  This principle does not apply to all forms of uncertainty. For example, when faced with deflationary shocks that risk rooting interest rates at the lower bound, it pays to act more decisively.[12] The same is true when inflation expectations are at risk of becoming de-anchored.[13] Both these considerations informed the ECB’s resolute response during the first phase of the pandemic.  And if measures to avoid market dislocations prove necessary in response to the war in Ukraine, we should intervene with equal determination, using all our instruments. In this respect, we reiterated in our February decisions that “within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability”. But when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policy on the economy, it is advisable to take small steps – and this is the case for the path out of the pandemic. Confronted with supply shocks that are both inflationary and contractionary, we should adjust our policy moderately and progressively as we receive feedback on the effects of our actions. We began reducing the pace of net asset purchases last year and we are on track to return to our pre-pandemic policy setting by September this year (Chart 15, left panel). Longer-term real yields have already returned to their pre-pandemic levels in the euro area (Chart 15, right panel).  The inflation outlook is stronger today than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, once the current crisis has abated, ensuring that monetary policy accompanies the recovery with a light touch may be consistent with a further adjustment in our net asset purchases. Beyond that, additional modifications to our stance should be considered carefully, for three main reasons.  First, in recent months euro area real yields have already risen more than in the United States, in spite of the different positions in the cycle (Chart 15, right panel). It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2% in a world of tighter financing conditions. This is especially important given that the equilibrium real interest rate is subject to large uncertainty (Chart 16), making it difficult to judge how far away we are from a neutral policy stance. Second, we need to be certain that removing accommodation too suddenly will not trigger market turmoil, as this could lead to financial markets overreacting and financing conditions tightening abruptly. This would set back the recovery in underlying inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at our target. We have already seen that, in the current environment, inflation expectations are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in the expected path of policy. Before the escalation of tensions in Ukraine, markets had brought forward their expectations of rate lift-off. This was associated with a reversal in the improvement of market-based inflation expectations (Chart 17, left panel).[14]  The fact that this decrease in inflation expectations was unique to the euro area[15] might have revealed concerns that the ECB would overreact to current inflation numbers and adjust its monetary policy too much and too quickly. These concerns were also hinted at by the shape of the €STR forward curve, which peaked in 2024 and then inverted somewhat, reflecting investors’ perceptions that the economy would be unable to sustain interest rates at those levels (Chart 17, right panel).  The end of net asset purchases in the euro area in 2018 was smooth mainly because short-term rates remained anchored by our forward guidance. We have not been in a situation before where markets are simultaneously reappraising the path of asset purchases and the path of rates, which could increase term premia along the yield curve. Moreover, markets are reappraising the tightening intentions of all major central banks at the same time, increasing the risk of undesirable spillovers on euro area financing conditions. Third, a key lesson from the previous crisis is not only that rates should not be raised prematurely, but also that doing so without the right framework in place can lead to renewed financial fragmentation. And this fragmentation could force monetary policy into a trade-off: we would face a choice between triggering an excessive tightening of financing conditions in some parts of the euro area, which would result in domestic demand that is too low, or adjusting the stance by less than would be optimal.  Today, fragmentation could result from the legacy effects of the pandemic, so we need a different mechanism for addressing it than during the financial crisis.[16] We have a framework that has served us well over the last two years, when the flexibility of our pandemic emergency purchase programme and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU instrument proved sufficient to stem fragmentation. This gives us a good indication of the direction we should now take. And we know from experience that the more credible a backstop is, the less likely it is to be used.

Faced with high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook with pitfalls on both sides, we should adjust policy carefully and recalibrate it as we see the effects of our decisions, so as to avoid suffocating the recovery and cement progress towards price stability.  That was already the case before the invasion of Ukraine, but this terrible event has made the need for prudence even greater. The world has become darker, and our steps should be smaller still.  At the ECB we stand by the people of Ukraine, who are now seeing what they hold dearest threatened by an unjustifiable act of aggression that violates the most fundamental principles of international law. That a country can be subjected to a full military invasion should steel our determination to defend those principles wherever we are, however we can.  The ECB’s role is clear: we will take any measures necessary, using all our instruments to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets. This is the duty of a central bank in times of emergency. And we will swiftly implement the sanctions decided on by the European Union. The scenes we have witnessed this past week will scar our memories forever. But I hope that, one day, we will look back on this moment and be proud that we did our duty, showed resolve and unity, and sought to uphold the universal values of peace, freedom and prosperity.    Brainard, W.C. (1967), “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 57, No 2, pp. 411-425. Around 60% of items in the inflation basket are currently above 2%, and the share of items that have seen price increases over the last three months is at a record high. Panetta, F. (2021a), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. The effect of higher energy prices is similar to that of a terms of trade tax that the euro area is paying to the rest of the world. See Panetta, F. (2021a), op. cit. Pre-crisis trends do not always represent the right benchmark for the recovery. The great financial crisis, for example, was created by excessive borrowing from the future which then had to be reabsorbed through a prolonged process of deleveraging. But the pandemic was a temporary exogenous shock which should not have significantly reduced the supply capacity of the economy. The pre-crisis growth path is therefore a reasonable standard. Panetta, F. (2021b), “Monetary autonomy in a globalised world”, welcome address at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world”, 26 April. For instance, Russia and Belarus produce large quantities of potash, Ukraine produces rare gases needed to produce lasers used in semi-conductor production, and Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of wheat. The ECB’s survey of large corporates paints a similar picture, foreseeing average wage increases to rise from around 2% in the recent past to 3% or more this year, although with significantly higher rates of wage growth in some sectors with labour shortages. See Gareis, J., Morris, R. and Roma, M. (2022), “Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies”, Economic Bulletin Issue 1, ECB. The average rate of negotiated wages growth was 1.5% in 2021 after 1.8% in 2020 as a whole, below our December projections. Consumers’ expectations, which arguably feed most directly into wage negotiations, show a distinct but temporary “hump” shape compared with January last year (the distribution in January 2022 shifts out for 1-year ahead expectations but shifts back in for 3-year ahead expectations, see Chart 13). Longer-term expectations are also becoming more concentrated around the 2% level compared with a year ago (Chart 14, left panel), while a growing number of monetary analysts see inflation stabilising at 2%, with only a small proportion seeing inflation above this target (Chart 14, right panel). Despite the surge in short-term inflation, recent research analysing the option-implied probabilities of tail events indicates that investors still fear the euro area may fall back into a deflationary trap in the future, whereas for the United States the opposite risk is higher. See Hilscher, J. Raviv Bar-Ilan, A. and Reis, R., (2022), How likely is an inflation disaster?, mimeo, London School of Economics, February. The paper also shows that in 2021 market perceptions of a high-inflation outcome rose significantly for the United States, but not for the euro area. These results (which estimate the tail probabilities for persistently very high or very low inflation using the prices of inflation options) reflect, among other things the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy regime. Brainard, W.C. (1967), —op. cit. In September 2020, for example, I made the argument that “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.” See Panetta, F. (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September. Söderström, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with Uncertain Parameters,” The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No 1, pp. 125-145. This fall is also visible in measures adjusted for risk premia at shorter horizons. In the United States and the United Kingdom measures of inflation expectations have remained broadly unchanged in recent weeks. In the past, the issue was resolved with an instrument – the Outright Monetary Transactions – designed for a situation where the main driver of fragmentation was unsound national policies, for which macroeconomic adjustment programmes were designed.</td></tr>\n",

This is a sad day for Europe and the world. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. In such times of extreme uncertainty, central banks need to be a source of confidence and a reliable anchor for the economy. Therefore, we are monitoring the situation closely. My remarks today reflect the macroeconomic situation predating the war. In the euro area, inflation has proven more persistent and more broad-based than expected, labour market slack is being reabsorbed at a faster pace than anticipated and pipeline pressures continue to build up. At the same time, prospects are rising that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may herald a turning point in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this environment, monetary policy needs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices today will not jeopardise price stability over the medium term. Households and firms count on the ECB to protect their purchasing power without putting at risk the current strong recovery from the crisis. Our policy framework enables us to deliver on these expectations. Our forward guidance has explicitly defined the conditions that need to be met for policy rates to be raised. And the clear sequence with which we intend to remove monetary stimulus, if and when necessary, reduces the uncertainty about how our actions will affect financing conditions and the broader economy. In the following, I will first discuss the current outlook for inflation. I will then explain the sequencing of policy measures that we will take once the Governing Council judges that policy should be normalised and will elaborate in more detail on three aspects that are more specific to the euro area. The first regards the question as to how the inflation outlook affects the policy normalisation process. The second point relates to how the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area affects the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. And the third point provides thoughts on how our sequence may interact with conditions in sovereign bond markets and the risks of fragmentation. A qualitative and quantitative change in the euro area’s inflation outlook A year ago, there was a widely shared expectation that inflation would rise sharply in response to the reopening of our economies but would subside swiftly as the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic would fade. There was a strong conviction that the combination of statistical base effects, slowing energy price inflation and the removal of one-off tax effects would mark a turning point in the euro area’s inflation trajectory towards the end of last year. These expectations have been disappointed. Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) continued to increase both in December 2021 and in January 2022, when it reached a new historical high of 5.1% (Slide 2). In January, euro area inflation surprised to the upside for the seventh consecutive month. Today, inflation is not only higher than expected, but price pressures are also visibly broadening. Measures of underlying inflation are following an unprecedented upward trend (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The prices of around two-thirds of the goods and services included in the HICP are currently increasing at an annual rate above 2% (Slide 3, right-hand chart). Less than a year ago, this share was close to 20%. Current measured inflation would be even higher if the costs of owner-occupied housing were included. Residential real estate prices continued to increase at an alarming pace. In the third quarter of 2021, prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 9% year-on-year, an unprecedented rate of increase (Slide 4, left-hand chart). If owner-occupied housing were included in the HICP, headline inflation in the third quarter of 2021 would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. For core inflation, the difference would have been twice as much – that is, core inflation would have been 2% rather than 1.4%, which is the largest difference observed since the start of the sample in 2012 (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Looking forward, the broad-based nature of recent upward surprises, extending well beyond the energy component, implies that significant uncertainty remains as to when the inflation peak will eventually be reached. What is becoming increasingly clear is that inflation is unlikely to fall back below our 2% target this year. It may increase even further over the near term before declining gradually over the course of 2022 as energy price inflation should slow. But the decline is not going to be nearly as fast as we previously anticipated. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2% target from above, rather than from below. The start of the year has seen three broad developments that corroborate this view. From pandemic to endemic? First, there are growing signs that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may bring forward the transition towards an endemic equilibrium. Although hospitalisations are still increasing in some countries alongside elevated case counts, admissions to intensive care units and fatality rates are now only a fraction of what they were in previous waves. There is a real chance that the Omicron variant could herald an inflection point after which the global community will be able to live with COVID-19 in spite of possible recurrent episodes of high case numbers. As governments worldwide are easing contact restrictions, the remaining slack in the economy will likely be reabsorbed at a faster pace than previously anticipated, in particular in contact-intensive services where the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on business and sentiment.  The most recent survey data corroborate this view for the euro area. In February, sentiment in the services sector improved sharply, back to levels seen before the discovery of the Omicron variant. A faster and more frontloaded recovery, in turn, risks increasing pressure on wages at a time when the labour market in the euro area is already showing first signs of strain. This brings me to the second point – the recovery in the labour market.  Strong recovery in the labour market Although the pandemic is still raging through the economy, slack in the labour market has continued to decline at a notably faster pace than projected (Slide 5, left-hand chart). A year ago, our central forecast was that the euro area unemployment rate would decline, on average, to 8.1% in 2022. In December 2021, the unemployment rate stood already at 7%. We are currently witnessing the strongest labour market in the history of the single currency. The unemployment rate is at a record low and below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), while the participation rate is at a record high (Slide 5, right-hand chart). Broader labour market slack, too, for which data are lagging, was already reabsorbed, by and large, by the end of the summer of last year, as strong demand is bringing more and more people – also those at the fringes of the labour market – back into work.[1]  While total hours worked still remained below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, there are good reasons to believe that the widespread easing of contact restrictions will help accelerate progress on that front too. Survey evidence confirms the picture of a tightening labour market. A rapidly rising share of firms across all economic sectors report shortages of labour as a factor limiting production. This is now the case for about a quarter to a third of all firms, a level never before observed in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand chart). Vacancy rates across the euro area are significantly higher than before the pandemic, which is consistent with firms reporting continued strong employment demand ahead (Slide 6, right-hand chart). These developments will add to pressure on wages as our economies continue to reopen. Although negotiated wage growth remains moderate, our latest corporate telephone survey among larger firms showed that wage pressures are expected to build up fast. Euro area firms anticipate considerably higher wage increases in the near term. For 2022, their average expected wage increase is 3.5%. The survey also showed that higher input costs, such as wages, are being passed through to consumer prices at a faster pace and to a larger extent than in the past, as strong pent-up demand creates a favourable environment for protecting or boosting profit margins. A faster pass-through, in turn, implies that for medium-term price pressures it is less relevant how fast wages expand today than how fast they will grow this year and next. Pipeline pressures remain elevated Third, pipeline pressures, which affect consumer price inflation with a lag, continue to build up. Import price inflation for intermediate and final consumer goods has increased further and remains at extraordinarily high levels (Slide 7, left-hand chart). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation reached a new all-time high in November. The inflation rate of services producer prices, which are an important element in the cost structure of both manufacturing and services firms, stands at 4.3%, which is almost nine times as high as its historical average. All services sectors report stronger price pressures than before the pandemic. These pipeline pressures will fade only gradually and will likely remain a source of upward pressure for consumer prices over the foreseeable future, with most firms expecting unusual cost pressures to persist for at least another six months. In addition, in large parts of the euro area the recent surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices will only be passed through to consumer prices with a lag. There is also a lot of uncertainty whether energy inflation will decline to the extent suggested by the futures curves underlying our December projections (Slide 7, right-hand chart). Brent oil spot prices are now at their highest levels since 2014 and current futures curves are well above the levels seen at the end of last year. Gas futures prices, too, are markedly higher than in December of last year. While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.[2]  In the EU, price developments under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) signal such an impending structural shift. ETS prices have recently reached a new record high of around €90 per tonne of carbon, almost three times as high as at the beginning of 2021, and they are expected to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. It is a reminder of the challenges we are facing in anticipating potential structural shifts in the underlying inflation process that could extend well beyond the energy sector.[3]  Sequencing of policy normalisation in the euro area All in all, there have been few instances in the recent past where the information set available to policymakers has changed so profoundly and in such a short period of time as has been the case since the beginning of the year. How today’s attack on Ukraine changes the euro area outlook is highly uncertain at this stage. We are monitoring the situation closely and will carefully evaluate the consequences for our policies. Based on the macroeconomic situation predating the war, however, inflationary pressures will likely prove stronger and more persistent over both the near and the medium term. Policy optionality is therefore needed more than ever to protect price stability.[4]  Our decisions in December of last year to end net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and to recalibrate the path of future purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) have been a first important step in this direction. At our next meeting in March, we will reassess whether the current path of asset purchases remains consistent with the updated inflation outlook, and we will thoroughly evaluate the progress made towards meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. While both the calibration and the time of adjustment of our policy instruments are data-dependent, the sequence with which we intend to adjust our policy stance is not. Our sequencing is subject to three guideposts. The first is our rate forward guidance, which provides the anchor for the normalisation process. It defines three conditions that need to be satisfied in the view of the Governing Council for our key policy rates to be raised: first, inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon; second, inflation remaining around 2% durably for the rest of the projection horizon; and, third, realised progress in underlying inflation being consistent with our inflation target. The second guidepost is that we will stop net asset purchases under the APP “shortly before” we increase our main policy rates. “Shortly before” is a term that is deliberately vague. It does not indicate a pre-defined distance between the end of our net asset purchases and policy rate lift-off. It does, however, imply that we will end net asset purchases under the APP once we judge that it is sufficiently likely that the rate forward guidance criteria are going to be fulfilled over the foreseeable future, while rates are going to be raised only when these conditions are actually met. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key policy rates. Again, the notion of an “extended period” is kept open to leave sufficient optionality in order to be able to respond to changes in the inflation outlook. In principle, this sequence is not very different from the one adapted by many other central banks, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. It defines a clear succession of steps that leaves sufficient flexibility to adjust the length of time needed before activating the next step of the sequence. That said, there are three considerations that are more specific to the euro area. Adjusting policy when inflation is converging to target The first relates to the inflation outlook. A central bank that faces a significant risk of inflation being markedly above target over the medium term would need to initiate a rapid sequence of policy rate hikes to above their estimated neutral levels. According to survey and market-based proxies, this would require bringing policy rates well into positive territory (Slide 8). However, these are not the conditions that we are facing today.  Rather, the economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2% target over the medium term. The current inflation outlook therefore calls for a gradual normalisation of our policy stance, reflecting the significant progress made towards meeting our inflation target in the future. During such a process of gradual normalisation, the focus should be first on unwinding step-by-step the exceptional measures we took to fight low inflation, starting with net asset purchases. The degree to which policy will need to be adjusted over time depends on how the inflation outlook continues to evolve. The focus on ending net asset purchases first reflects, at least in part, the fact that their side effects tend to increase over time.[5]  The experience of the past few years demonstrates, for example, that balance sheet policies have a significantly larger impact on house prices than changes in short-term policy rates, thereby contributing to the measurable rise in residential real estate prices (Slide 9).[6]  Similarly, years of balance sheet expansion have caused the bond free float in some economies to decline to very low levels (Slide 10, left-hand chart). As such, an end to net asset purchases enhances the availability of safe assets that the market requires to function well (Slide 10, right-hand chart).[7]  Ending net asset purchases when inflation is robustly converging to our target also credibly underlines that our actions are solely guided by our mandate, refuting concerns about fiscal dominance. Finally, in the current environment of large imported inflation, reversing the current exceptional measures has the potential to mitigate inflationary pressures even without the usual long lag in policy transmission. Over the past years, these measures have contributed to large capital outflows from the euro area, thereby putting downward pressure on the euro exchange rate (Slide 11). The exit from these measures can thus support the currency and, for a net importer of energy, provide tangible and immediate support to euro area households and firms by improving the terms of trade. Choice of policy instruments The second aspect relates to the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. This choice crucially depends on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The euro area remains a bank-based economy. Although market-based debt financing has gained importance since the global financial crisis, bank credit remains by far the dominant source of external finance for euro area firms (Slide 12, left-hand chart).[8]  The financing structure, in turn, has important implications for how strongly a given monetary impulse is transmitted to the real economy. Recent ECB staff analysis finds that when the share of bank loans in total external finance is high, like in the euro area, real GDP growth often shows only a weak response to changes in long-term interest rates (Slide 12, right-hand chart). In other words, our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process. Most of firms’ credit is either linked directly to short-term rates in financial markets, such as the EURIBOR, or has fixed maturities of short duration. Half of outstanding loans to euro area firms have a maturity of one year or less. Long-term rates are not only less relevant for policy transmission, central banks also have only indirect control over the part that is not related to the expected future path of short-term interest rates, i.e. the term premium.  The latter is affected by a host of factors, such as inflation uncertainty, global spillovers or demand by price-insensitive investors. The stock of bonds held by central banks is just one of these factors. Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance. This is also why our sequence foresees that policy lift-off will predate with some distance a reduction of our balance sheet. Risks of fragmentation This brings me to my third consideration – the question as to whether and how changes in sovereign bond market conditions could challenge our sequencing. Despite significant progress in recent years, the euro area’s institutional architecture remains incomplete. In the absence of a common fiscal capacity, and with public debt at elevated levels owing to the pandemic, parts of the euro area remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. There are three mitigating factors at present, however. One is that the combination of a long period of historically low rates and the marked increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt has measurably reduced the sensitivity of debt to changes in market interest rates. The average interest rate will remain low for some time even if the marginal interest rate starts rising (Slide 13, left-hand chart). Second, with average interest rates remaining low, and inflation receding only gradually, the strong expected recovery over the coming years should lead to a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios (Slide 13, right-hand chart). Structural reforms and large-scale investments related to Next Generation EU should foster confidence in the capacity of euro area countries to generate sustained high growth. Third, our decision in December last year to reinvest flexibly under the PEPP provides a strong mechanism to preserve the transmission of monetary policy in the event of severe and self-fulfilling market dislocations that would jeopardise the achievement of our mandate. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter renewed negative shocks related to the pandemic. Hence, we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation, while our monetary policy stance is guided by our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Conclusion Let me conclude. The inflation outlook has firmed since the start of the year. Inflationary pressures have broadened and have become more persistent. The expected easing of contact restrictions, together with the strong recovery in the labour market and elevated pipeline pressures have increased upside risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, the shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook. In this environment, we need to carefully reflect on how much monetary policy stimulus is required for inflation to stabilise at our target over the medium term, so as to neither fall below 2% once the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic fade, nor to allow an extended period of high inflation to become entrenched over time. This uncertainty speaks in favour of a gradual and data-dependent normalisation that respects the sequence that we have communicated, with a view to reducing uncertainty about our actions and intentions.

It is more than 30 years now since the first Anti-money Laundering Directive was published in June 1991. Since then, the framework has undergone many improvements, with the previous – fifth – AML Directive being published in May 2018.  The framework grew both in terms of the number and the forms of the regulatory instruments involved, incorporating both regulations and directives, as well as regulatory technical standards and guidelines developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Market Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. Nevertheless, the AML Directive has remained the core of the legal framework.  The ECB provided opinions on many of those legislative proposals. The ECB does not and cannot have any mandate to exercise anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. However, as my ECB Supervisory Board colleague Edouard Fernandez-Bollo aptly articulated in a recently published blog post: “Some things matter to you, even if you are not directly responsible for them.”  The EU AML/CFT framework affects the ECB’s tasks relating to the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the tasks that fall within its central banking mandate.  In particular, it is important for the ECB to factor the outcomes of AML/CFT supervision into its prudential supervisory processes. The risk of the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing is relevant for ECB prudential supervisory decisions on acquisitions of qualifying holdings in supervised entities, granting and withdrawing authorisations to credit institutions, and suitability assessments of existing or prospective managers of supervised entities. The outcomes of AML/CFT supervision are also reflected in day-to-day supervision as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.  Since the exchange of confidential information between the ECB and the AML/CFT supervisors was enabled in 2018 by an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, the ECB, as a prudential supervisor, has concluded an agreement on information exchange with more than 50 AML/CFT supervisory authorities across all Members States of the European Economic Area. This cooperation was further enhanced by subsequent amendments to the Directive in 2019, as well as by the establishment of AML/CFT colleges, in which the ECB participates as an observer. Over the past years the ECB has also been actively contributing to the work of the EBA’s AML Standing Committee. Good and efficient cooperation with AML/CFT supervisory authorities is therefore an important priority for us. Last year, following discussions in the Council of the EU, the Commission presented a set of legislative proposals for major changes to the EU AML/CFT framework: The first substantial change consists in transforming most of the requirements addressed to private entities from the AML Directive to a directly applicable EU regulation.  The second, and even more fundamental change is the establishment of a new authority at the EU level with a mandate for both direct and indirect AML/CFT supervision across all EU Member States. We see this as an important shift which has the potential to bring a more harmonised application of EU AML/CFT requirements and convergence of practices in AML/CFT supervision across the EU.  The third and most prominent change, which concerns the ECB’s central banking activities, is the introduction of an EU-wide limit to payments in cash. This type of measure has so far only been implemented at the level of individual Member States by means of national legislation. In the past the ECB has opined on a number of such national legislative measures. The legislative package published by the Commission consists of four legislative acts. The ECB was consulted on most elements of the legislative package by the European Parliament and the Council in October 2021. The ECB Governing Council recently adopted and published its opinions on all four elements of the package. My colleagues will give more details on the main themes which the ECB opinions touch upon. Most of the observations and suggestions in the ECB opinions seek to improve the framework of cooperation and information exchange with the future AML Authority, as well as the national AML/CFT authorities.  The ECB incorporated in its opinions its experience from establishing EU-level prudential supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, to the extent that it could be useful in establishing the EU-level AML/CFT supervision. I would like to highlight that the criteria for identifying the selected entities that will be under the direct supervision of the future AML Authority are relatively strict. The Commission envisages that only between 12 and 20 obliged entities will meet these criteria. Based on its experience, the ECB would strongly support amending these criteria such that a wider pool of obliged entities would be directly supervised by the AML Authority, including entities headquartered in each Member State. This would promote a common supervisory culture and convergence of AML/CFT supervisory practices.  Also, considering the strict, risk-based nature of the selection criteria, the publication of the list of selected obliged entities would be tantamount to indirectly disclosing the high money laundering risk status of selected supervised entities, sending unintended signals to the markets or creating reputational issues for selected obliged entities directly supervised by the new AML authority.  The most prominent element of the ECB opinions is the analysis of the proposed limit to cash payments. While the proposed limit of €10,000 euro does not appear problematic, the ECB brings several considerations to the attention of the co-legislators with a view to protecting the legal tender status of euro banknotes, in line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU.  Let me now hand over to my colleagues who will present the ECB opinions in greater detail.

And thank you to the Chair of the panel for allowing me to open the discussion with some remarks on the importance of transition planning. I fully appreciate the irony of what I’m about to say, what with you in Paris and me here on-screen, but we are all on the path to Paris. Citizens, firms, banks and prudential supervisors alike are working towards the climate goals agreed in 2015 as the EU and national governments roll out policies implementing the Paris Agreement.  In previous speeches, I have stressed the need for banks to put in place transition plans compatible with EU policies implementing the Paris Agreement – plans with concrete intermediate milestones to enhance banks’ long-term strategies and decision-making. More and more banks are already doing this themselves, while the European Commission also called for enhanced transition planning in its sustainable finance strategy published in July 2021.  For ECB Banking Supervision, the main concern that needs to be addressed by these transition plans is the level of banks’ risk exposures and the effectiveness of their controls. Have the exposures been sufficiently mitigated and are they prudent? As climate-related and environmental risks become increasingly widespread and more material, banks will, inevitably, be exposed to them, through both physical and transition risks. Banks therefore need adequate risk mitigation measures in place. This is what we need to assess as the prudential supervisor.  Introducing a legal requirement for banks to have a clear, detailed and prudent transition plan in place would increase the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory framework and contribute to maintaining a level playing field. Needless to say, we are very happy to see that this is exactly what the European Commission has proposed in its review of the Capital Requirements Directive, which is now with the co-legislators.  But it doesn’t stop there. For banks to be able to manage their transition risks adequately, they need to have information on how their customers are performing relative to a Paris-aligned transition path. This is where the European Commission’s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive comes in. The ECB welcomed this proposed directive in a legal opinion and it is now awaiting approval by the co-legislators.  The current standards on sustainability disclosure are insufficient to ensure that sustainability-related financial risks are properly understood and priced by market participants. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is a necessary step to address the gaps that currently hinder the development of appropriate sustainability policy, risk assessment and risk monitoring frameworks for the financial sector. This is because it will not only explicitly ask large banks to disclose their transition plans, it will also ask banks’ corporate clients to do the same. This last point is crucial, as it will enable banks to assess the climate-related and environmental risks in their asset portfolios. These disclosures are therefore an important element in ensuring that banks manage all material risks, in line with what we as the prudential supervisor expect them to do.  The climate-and-environmental puzzle is still highly complicated, but we can now see the pieces slotting into place. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the elements included in the Commission’s proposals are implemented in actual binding legislation entering into force without undue delay.

Throughout history, money and payments have been constantly evolving. And this also holds true in the digital age. As we increasingly pay digitally and shop online, we rely less on cash. Our wallets are gradually moving from our pockets to smartphones and other electronic devices.  These changes have profound implications for the nature of money itself, raising the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies for retail use.  Today I will argue that in a digital world CBDCs are necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilising force at the heart of the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty.  But CBDCs will need to be carefully designed. To be successful, they will need to add value for users, support competition rather than crowd out private innovation, and avoid risks to financial intermediation.  Why we need central bank digital money Our monetary system is based on the complementarity of private money with public money – which is available for retail payments in the form of banknotes.[1]  Confidence in private means of payment is determined by our ability to convert private money into safe public money. This is because central bank money is a risk-free form of money that is guaranteed by the State: by its strength, its credibility, its authority.  Other types of money are liabilities of private issuers: their value is based on the soundness of the issuer and is underpinned by the promise of one-to-one convertibility with central bank money.[2] Our readiness to hold private money such as bank deposits reflects the confidence that we can always go to a branch or a cash machine and convert our deposits into cash. The fact that we can do this tells us that our deposits are safe. It reassures us that we will be able to convert them into risk-free central bank money in the future, too.  Bank runs and financial crises start when confidence in the convertibility of private money evaporates.[3] Without the anchor of sovereign money, people would constantly have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money. This would undermine confidence in the singleness of money and impair the functioning of the payments system.[4]  History provides examples for this. In times when various forms of private money coexisted in the absence of sovereign money – such as the free banking era of the 19th century – the notes issued by banks often traded at variable prices[5] and instability risks[6] required dominant banks and clearinghouses to act as quasi-central banks[7]. The consensus among central banks on the coexistence between public and private money was summarised 20 years ago as follows: “The composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency. In other words, central banks would accept neither an outcome in which central bank money crowds out private initiative, nor an outcome in which central bank money is phased out by a market mechanism.”[8]  In the digital age, however, banknotes could lose their role as a reference value in payments, undermining the integrity of the monetary system.[9] Central banks must therefore consider how to ensure that their money can remain a payments anchor in a digital world.  Some have suggested that innovative private payment solutions such as stablecoins could, if properly regulated, make CBDCs superfluous.[10] However, confidence in stablecoins would also depend on the ability to convert them into central bank money,[11] unless stablecoin issuers were allowed to invest the reserve assets in risk-free deposits at the central bank. But this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money, which would endanger monetary sovereignty.[12] Moreover, in the absence of public money, stablecoins could exacerbate the “winner-takes-all” dynamics inherent in payment markets, with adverse consequences for the functioning of the payments system.[13] And stablecoins’ potentially large investments in safe assets could affect the availability of these assets.[14] This could in turn have an impact on market functioning and real interest rates, with undesirable implications from a monetary policy perspective.[15]  Other threats to monetary sovereignty could emerge in the absence of a domestic digital currency. If a foreign CBDC were to be widely adopted, this could lead to digital currency substitution[16]. This risk would be higher for small countries with unstable currencies and weak fundamentals, especially if the CBDC were issued in a major economy.[17] But it could eventually also affect leading currencies.[18]  Such risks are not imminent, but they should not be underestimated. Just as the US dollar overtook the pound sterling as the leading reserve currency within only a decade of the end of the First World War,[19] digital innovation may give rise to powerful new foreign contenders, with disruptive consequences for those markets that are not prepared to face the digital challenge.  The widespread adoption of a foreign CBDC would increase the risk of financial transactions being based on technologies managed and supervised elsewhere, with limited oversight by domestic authorities. A system of this kind may not have sufficient safeguards against external threats, including cyber threats. It could put the confidential data of people, businesses, and states at greater risk of being misused. And it could make the information needed to counter criminal activities harder to trace.  The scenario I am describing is not one of science fiction. It is already the case in the market for crypto-assets, which are widely used for criminal activities.[20] A similar situation might affect other digital asset markets in the future. So the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted, and this will make a big difference.[21] But it may not be sufficient.  The main benefits of CBDCs  A CBDC would preserve the coexistence of sovereign and private money in a digital world. This is not an abstract benefit – it is the basis for financial and monetary stability, ensuring competition and efficiency in payment markets. But a CBDC could generate even more benefits for users.  It could improve the confidentiality of digital payments. The information contained in electronic transactions can be monetised by private companies[22], posing a threat to privacy. This risk is further compounded by big techs starting to offer financial services and by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Data protection regulation aims to prevent misuse, but cannot always keep pace with technological innovation, as we have seen in past cases of data breaches and misuse by tech companies.[23]  If a digital currency were offered by an independent public institution such as the central bank – which has no interest in exploiting individual payment data for any purpose – it could enhance, not reduce, the confidentiality of electronic payments. Potential users clearly want this: when we consulted the public on the topic, privacy was identified as the most important aspect of a digital euro.[24] Sound governance arrangements that comply with data protection regulations would ensure that payment information is only accessed for permitted purposes, such as countering illegal activities. We are cooperating with the relevant European authorities on this issue.  A digital euro would also increase choice and reduce costs, contributing to a level playing field in payments.[25] Key segments of the euro area payments market, such as cards and e-payments, are dominated by a handful of players, which strengthens their pricing power. Some estimates suggest that Europeans pay about 1.4% of GDP for payments services. In the United States, the costs are higher.[26]  One might argue that private service providers are already well equipped to offer low-cost digital payment solutions. However, the limited evidence available suggests that low-income households use digital payments less than high-income households. This is consistent with the hypothesis that digital payments remain expensive for many users.[27] And even in advanced financial systems, many citizens are “unbanked” or “underbanked”.[28] Although financial inclusion depends on several factors, such as financial and digital literacy, the cost of financial services is likely to play a role.  Our digital euro project comes with a commitment that all – including vulnerable population groups – will have access to safe public money in the digital era.  Designing a successful digital euro  The fact that CBDCs are necessary to guarantee the smooth functioning of the payments market does not mean that their success should be taken for granted. Users may lack incentives to fully appreciate such benefit and – given the vast supply of private digital monies – could show limited interest in CBDCs. Indeed, we face two opposite risks: being “too successful” and crowding out private payment solutions and financial intermediation, or being “not successful enough” and generating insufficient demand. We take both risks seriously.  To avoid interfering with the functioning of the financial system, we are considering how to make the digital euro a convenient medium of exchange but not an attractive form of investment. We are examining the pros and cons of introducing a quantitative cap on digital euro holdings[29] or a tiered remuneration that would disincentivise excessive holdings.[30] We are analysing the potential impact on monetary policy. To ensure that our digital currency would be a convenient means of payment, we are working to make it available within private payment solutions, so that people would be able to use it easily wherever they can pay digitally. We aim to level the playing field by allowing intermediaries – including small ones – to offer innovative solutions to their customers. And we are considering how a digital euro could improve financial inclusion. We are interviewing focus groups to identify the characteristics of a digital euro that would add value for users. And we are working on the technical options to reconcile different objectives such as the right of individuals to confidentiality versus the public interest in guaranteeing the transparency required to counter illegal activities; or the benefits of allowing the digital euro to be widely used versus the need to safeguard financial intermediation.  We have launched several work streams: on the design choices that can guarantee confidentiality, on the prioritisation of different use cases,[31] and on the business options for intermediaries[32]. We will cover areas such as cyber security and operational resilience.  We are interacting with all relevant stakeholders, from intermediaries to consumers, merchants and authorities. We are cooperating with the European Parliament, the European Commission and the finance ministers of the euro area countries. To get technical advice and collect a broad range of views on possible solutions, we have set up a Market Advisory Group[33] and are regularly discussing the project with the Euro Retail Payments Board[34], academics and think tanks. Bearing in mind the international implications of CBDCs,[35] we are cooperating with other major central banks. In October 2021 we launched a two-year investigation phase to define the design features of the digital currency. At the end of 2023 we could decide to start a realisation phase to develop and test the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro, which could take three years. Only thereafter will we decide whether to actually issue a digital euro.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  For decades, the complementarity of public money and private money has guaranteed stability, competition and innovation.  The digitalisation of payments cannot be ignored by central banks, which have so far provided their money only in physical form. Central banks cannot escape these transformations, nor should they underestimate the potential for far-reaching shifts that may occur.  To ensure that public money maintains its fundamental role in the digital age, the ECB has launched an investigation into the possible issuance of a digital euro alongside cash.  The digital euro is an ambitious and complex project that can improve the efficiency of the economic and financial system. We want to make it a driver of stability and inclusive progress, capable of strengthening ties between economies and financial systems around the world. Our experience may provide useful insights for other central banks. And likewise, we are keen to learn from them. I am therefore pleased to exchange views with US experts, and I am now looking forward to our discussion.    Although central bank money can also take the form of reserves (deposits that commercial banks hold at the central bank), the focus of this speech will be on cash. One-to-one convertibility with central bank money is what makes the regulated forms of money convertible with each other and is why they are perceived as interchangeable when making payments. This does not mean that the safeguards put in place to protect savings – legislation and banking supervision, deposit insurance schemes, capital markets supervision – are not important. On the contrary. They must, however, be flanked by convertibility to ensure the smooth functioning of payments and the stability of the financial system. On the singleness of money see Bank for International Settlements (2003),  The role of central bank money in payment systems , Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, August. For instance, the notes of new banks were more heavily discounted. See Gorton, G. (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No 2, pp. 346-397. Price variability was inconvenient, as users had to consult a note reporter to monitor the value of the notes in circulation. See Eichengreen, B. (2019), “From Commodity to Fiat and Now to Crypto: What Does History Tell Us?”, NBER Working Paper Series, No 25426, January. The experience of the free banking era in the United States varied considerably among states and each had a significant number of problem banks. See Rolnick, A.J. and Weber, W.E. (1983), “New Evidence on the Free Banking Era”, American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No 5, pp. 1080-1091. In the United States, dominant banks disciplined note issuing banks by threatening them with bulk redemption of their notes, while clearinghouses regulated member bank levels of equity, reserves, and interest rates, audited members, produced money during crises and issued a form of insurance; See Gorton, G. (1985), “Banking theory and free banking history: A Review Essay”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 16(2), 267-276. See Bank for International Settlements (2003), op. cit. For an overview of the role of central bank money over the past 20 years, see Bindseil, U., and Terol, I (2020), “The evolving role of central bank money in payments”, Central Banking, 15 July. While banks could continue to hold central bank money in the form of reserves, this may not prove sufficient to fully preserve the monetary anchor role of central bank money. People would be unable to use central bank money as means of exchange and would thus have little incentive to hold it. This would weaken the unit of account role of sovereign money. If the currency is not demanded by the public, the mere announcement that the central bank would make it available would not be enough to preserve its role in the economy. In history, sovereign money was at times used as unit of account but not as a medium of exchange. This was for example the case of the livre, the “imaginary money” introduced by Charlemagne in the monetary reform of the eighth century, named after the libra (pound), the sovereign money introduced by the ancient King of Rome Servius Tullius in the sixth century BC. The livre was never coined and never circulated. However, it had a fixed conversion rate with another form of sovereign money, the denier (1 livre was equal to 240 deniers), which was actually coined and actively used as means of exchange.

The value of a stablecoin is linked to a portfolio of one or more other assets (the reserve assets), including currency in the form of commercial bank deposits. Stablecoins can therefore be low-risk but not risk-free. Risks increase if stablecoin arrangements are backed by risky or opaque assets, especially in times of market turmoil.

New players, including operating platforms with huge customer bases, can exploit network effects and economies of scale to build dominant positions, creating their own closed-loop ecosystems. They may exploit customer data for private scoring and other uses. They may erect barriers to impede interoperability and use their “coins” to displace other forms of money.

While the international role of a currency will continue to depend to a large extent on the fundamentals of the underlying economy, availability in CBDC form would facilitate use in cross-border payments by reducing frictions and costs. Model simulations suggest that the share of a country’s currency in global export payments increases when it is available as a CBDC, but continues to depend to a large extent on forces such as the size and the stability of the economy and the development and efficiency of the financial sector.

The European Union is revising the regulation, supervision and oversight of digital finance with the proposed Regulation of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and the ECB’s new payment oversight framework (PISA). The discussion on regulatory steps is also ongoing in other advanced economies, e.g. in the United States.

Beyond the well-known case of Oxford Analytica, big tech firms are facing increased criticism over revelations that staff and contractors listened to audio recordings of people speaking to virtual assistants, and voice chats recorded on messenger apps. Even children were affected: one major video-sharing app popular among young people was heavily fined in 2019 by the US Federal Trade Commission for collecting personal data from children under 13. See New Scientist (2019),  Big tech data abuse capped off Silicon Valley's decade-long fall , 18 December. In the public consultation conducted by the ECB in 2020, 43% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of a digital euro, well ahead of other features. The other characteristics highlighted in the consultation were the security of payments and usability throughout the euro area, which were ranked first by 18% and 11% of those surveyed, respectively. See Panetta, F. (2021), “A digital euro to meet the expectations of Europeans”, introductory remarks at the ECON Committee of the European Parliament, 14 April. See Panetta, F.

See McKinsey (2020),  The 2020 McKinsey Global Payments Report.  Based on the Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE), the preference for cash in the euro area is significantly higher among low-income respondents. While only 36% of those with an income of €1,000 per month or less have a preference for cards or other cashless means of payment, that preference was expressed by 61% in the income bracket of €2,500 and more. See Panetta, F. (2021), “Cash still king in times of COVID-19”, speech at the Deutsche Bundesbank’s 5th International Cash Conference on “Cash in times of turmoil”, 15 June. Although they are often invisible to the customer, the various layers of merchant fees can add up to some 3% of the transaction value. According to Glory Global Solutions, “Some banks tell merchants to budget for between 2.5% and 3% of the transaction valuable, but with so many variables, this is only ever a rough guide.” See Glory Global Solutions (2018),  Electronic Payments – Not As Cheap As You Think . In the United States, 6% of adults do not have a checking, savings, or money market account. See Federal Reserve (2019),  Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2018 - May 2019 . In the euro area there are still more than 5% of adults without a payment account. See World Bank (2017),  Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database  .  In the case of quantitative holding limits, we are considering waterfall solutions linking digital euro accounts to private money accounts, to allow payments in excess of the limit. Bindseil, U.

Use cases refer to the various interactions between people, businesses, Government and machines (e.g. payments at the point of sale, online, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, etc.). Business options are naturally related to costs (fees, devices), but can also include the front end, taking into account consumers’ preference to use the current payment methods, be it their smartphone, card or cash. A digital euro should provide a similar payment experience, while also considering future innovations like QR codes, which are becoming more and more popular. The Market Advisory Group includes 30 professionals from the retail payments industry and provides advice on the design and potential role of a digital euro in the payments ecosystem.

Our focus today is the current state of C&amp;E risk management practices in the banking sector, and the ECB’s upcoming thematic review of these risks. Over the last couple of years, we have launched several targeted actions in this direction. In 2020 we issued the ECB guide on C&amp;E risks and in 2021 we conducted a supervisory review of banks’ approaches to managing these risks based on their own assessments. The ECB has progressively taken C&amp;E risks into greater account in its supervision, as have banks in their business.  2022 will be the year that C&amp;E risks become integrated in the day-to-day activities of our joint supervisory teams, who are in constant contact with banks. These risks will come to form an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with supervised entities and the supervisory review and evaluation process, the SREP. This will ultimately influence banks’ minimum capital requirements. The encompassing and integrated approach – which supervisors and banks are already very familiar with for traditional risk categories – is what I call the immersive supervisory approach to C&amp;E risks. Along with the 2022 ECB supervisory stress test, the thematic review forms part of the ECB Banking Supervision roadmap to ensure that banks adequately incorporate C&amp;E risk management. These supervisory activities complement the ECB’s broader C&amp;E agenda, which includes publishing the results of an economy-wide climate change stress test, and our 2021 action plan to include climate change considerations in our monetary policy. The state of C&amp;E risk management  Climate and environmental risks are impossible to avoid. The public knows it and the ECB knows it. The banks themselves now know it, as reflected in the outcome of their internal assessments. All banks that thoroughly assessed their exposure to C&amp;E risks concluded that these risks are material. By contrast, not a single materiality assessment submitted by banks that reported no material risk exposure was deemed adequate. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the banks that acknowledged the materiality of the C&amp;E risks they faced did so for both transition and physical risks. And they acknowledged that these risks are material in both the short and the long term. Despite this broad acknowledgement of the materiality of these risks, and thus the need to adequately manage them, we see that most banks still have a considerable way to go in developing their risk management capabilities. As the findings we published last year show, banks reported that 90% of their practices are only partially or not at all in line with ECB supervisory expectations. Let me repeat: 90%. This is both bad news and good news. Bad news because, at the time of their assessment, banks were a long way away from where they needed to be. But good news because half the banks we supervise already acknowledge that climate risks are an inevitable part of their day-to-day business. We therefore expect banks to analyse how C&amp;E risks can or will affect their portfolios and products over the short, medium and long term, and under various scenarios, too. This type of forward-looking analysis of C&amp;E risk should be basic practice, just as it would be for any other type of risk. Moreover, beyond merely formally attributing responsibilities, we still see banks making little progress towards more actively managing the C&amp;E risks they face. Even certain banks that recognise the materiality of C&amp;E risks have not reported any practices to either reduce or manage their level of risk. This year we want to see firm progress in how banks incorporate C&amp;E risks in their risk management. In doing so, banks should adopt a strategic approach to managing these risks, using the full array of the risk management instruments at their disposal. This includes strategically realigning portfolios, setting clear risk appetites, developing mitigation strategies, adjusting qualitative credit criteria and quantifying and holding capital. Another key area in which banks can make progress is by actively supporting their clients in mitigating and adapting to the different types of climate and environmental risks. Moreover, banks can draw on the industry’s good practices that we shared last year in our report. In the face of data challenges and methodological uncertainties, banks have an even stronger imperative to get moving. To be clear, banks should not misconstrue the ECB’s actions as an outright call for divesting from carbon-intensive activities or from geographical regions vulnerable to physical risk. Rather, we are asking banks to fully grasp the physical and transition risks and to actively start managing them, with the aim of making their portfolios more resilient to C&amp;E risks. Not all sectors will decarbonise overnight. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios show that certain sectors will continue to rely on carbon-intensive technologies for some time. We as prudential supervisors merely need banks to understand what the transition entails for their risk exposures to those sectors, and to reflect it in their overall risk management strategy. What we do not expect is an outright withdrawal from carbon-intensive industries, nor do we expect it to happen for every single sector or counterparty – but we do expect banks to harbour the capacity to manage the risks emerging from climate change. To draw a comparison with traditional risk exposures, we, as supervisors, would of course not expect banks to divest from all assets that entail credit risks, but we do insist that these risks are managed appropriately. C&amp;E risks are to be managed just like any other risk; and their sound management requires sound risk controls. This is precisely one of our focus areas in the upcoming thematic review on C&amp;E risks. Supervisory roadmap for C&amp;E risks For several years, the ECB has identified banks’ exposure to C&amp;E risks as one of the main vulnerabilities in the European banking sector. Assessing and helping banks address risks stemming from climate change and environmental degradation will be one of our supervisory priorities from now until 2024, albeit these risks have been on our minds for far longer. I remember giving my first speeches on this topic in late 2015 when still an executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank. So, we have already come a long way and our supervision of C&amp;E risks will now take more concrete form. The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&amp;E risks.  The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&amp;E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the banks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front.  The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C&amp;E risks, which is a key topic of the session today. Two years after we launched the supervisory guide on C&amp;E risks, we are conducting this thematic review to follow up on the self-assessment exercise conducted last year. Our main goal will be to assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks’ C&amp;E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C&amp;E risk strategies and risk profiles. Do all banks’ processes and analyses have visible consequences? Does the way in which banks actually steer their balance sheets and risk profiles reflect the materiality of C&amp;E risks? These will be some of the core questions of this review.  As part of this exercise, we will monitor banks’ alignment with the supervisory expectations set out in the guide, and encourage banks’ progress towards the industry’s best practices. Fortunately, those practices were identified across different European banks over the last two years. They show that some banks are already doing what we are asking. The ECB is doing its part by guiding banks in their climate journey, setting forth supervisory expectations and sharing updates on good practices in the industry. In light of the efforts banks have already made in devising their action plans, as well as all the information on this topic published to date – by both the ECB and several other public and private organisations we expect to see material progress in banks’ implementation deadlines and concrete actions.  As part of the thematic review, we will also be looking more closely at the risk management practices for environmental risks such as risks to biodiversity, water stress and pollution. All have similar features and warrant a coordinated approach. Banks can make significant savings if, taking advantage of the momentum, they extend the range of their preparations to cover all these risks, and are thus ready for a new, more concrete, supervisory and regulatory environment. Our benchmark from last year shows that, as of early 2021, very few banks were looking into environmental risks beyond climate. We have highlighted this gap to banks. This year, we will assess how banks are managing their exposures to environmental risks beyond climate and follow up accordingly.  As we build our joint supervisory teams’ capacity to help banks understand and incorporate C&amp;E risks, our supervisors will treat these risks just like any other. Last year’s review was conducted by a central team of experts, with the joint supervisory teams conducting the follow-up dialogue with the bank. By contrast, this thematic review will be fully embedded in the work of every joint supervisory team. While still backed by a central team of experts, the review will be driven from the engine room of supervision. And this is where the supervision of C&amp;E risks will stay. Following up on the thematic review, all banks under our direct supervision will receive comprehensive feedback setting out any shortcomings identified. Combined with the observations from the climate stress test, this will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. Targeted qualitative requirements may also be imposed. As part of the review, we will also carefully check whether banks have followed up on any requirements we issued last year. The thematic review is a full-on supervisory review. As such, we also have the full set of supervisory measures at our disposal to address shortcomings. Those banks that continue to fail to conduct a materiality assessment of C&amp;E risks or have not followed-up on earlier requirements will start noticing just that. Regulatory and supervisory framework  The ECB is taking action under its mandate and under the current prudential framework to get banks to where they need to be in terms of incorporating C&amp;E risks into their business. Our supervisory activities are thus keeping in line with the rapidly evolving regulatory and supervisory framework.  For example, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive proposed by the European Commission will further articulate the integration of C&amp;E risks in the legal framework and will require banks to develop transition plans and supervisors to scrutinise them. This is the next important step in risk management, which I have mentioned on previous occasions, and which will require banks to look thirty years ahead and devise intermediate targets for their risk exposures that can render their risk management practices fit for an economy that will transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.  And finally, disclosure frameworks and taxonomies are also developing rapidly to create an information architecture to enable banks to manage the risks and scale up green finance. Both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have intensive work programmes to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework can better cater for climate-related risks. One concrete example is the EBA’s recently published implementing technical standards for the disclosure of Environmental Social and Governance risks, which also require large banks to start disclosing their alignment with the IEA pathways by June 2024 at the latest for all relevant portfolios. Banks are running out of time to complete their preparations. On all these fronts, the sooner banks act, the smoother the transition will be for them, and for the economy they help support.  Conclusion  For ECB Banking Supervision, 2022 marks the third year of dedicated C&amp;E risk activities. First, we issued our guide with supervisory expectations. Next, we asked banks to share with us their self-assessments on how their practices match our expectations. And they have indeed been very open and candid in these self-assessments, for which I am truly grateful.  Together we have learnt that there is a lot of room for improvement. Considering the importance, urgency and long-lasting nature of climate change, we are asking banks to intensify their efforts in measuring and managing C&amp;E risks in line with our expectations. With the exercises that we are conducting this year, the prudential supervision of climate-related risks is moving closer to maturity. The thematic review is the next step in fully immersing C&amp;E risks in the work of the joint supervisory teams and marks key progress towards their integration in the SREP. It crystalises our commitment to ensuring that the prudential supervision of C&amp;E risks is here to stay.



Across advanced economies, the current inflation spike is proving to be broader and more persistent than initially expected, leading central banks to reassess the risk that it could become entrenched. This is no easy task, especially in the euro area.  Economic conditions in the euro area have benefited from the strong response of monetary policy and its positive interactions with fiscal policy during the pandemic. But this is not a typical business cycle, and we are not seeing a typical recovery.  The current inflation spike is for the most part not being driven by domestic factors – by an economy that is “running hot”, in other words. Demand remains below its pre-crisis trend.  Instead, the economy is experiencing a series of imported supply shocks that are pushing up inflation and depressing demand. The exit from the pandemic is characterised by global mismatches between demand and supply – in energy and goods markets in particular – with uneven effects across sectors.  As a result, past economic regularities may be a poor guide for the future.  This makes medium-term developments extremely hard to anticipate. There are forces at play that could delay the recovery and contain underlying price pressures, and others that could lead to accelerating inflation. Policy mistakes in either direction could push the economy onto an unfavourable path.  Faced with such uncertainty, there is a case for the central bank to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps in adjusting policy, so as not to suffocate the as yet incomplete recovery.  If we are to durably escape the low inflation and low growth environment that has defined the past decade, we cannot afford to waste the progress we have made so far. In the spirit of William Brainard{[}1{]}, we should take small steps in a dark room. The dramatic conflict in Ukraine is now weighing negatively on both supply and demand conditions, making uncertainty more acute and exacerbating risks to the medium-term inflation outlook on both sides. In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer. And the ECB stands ready to act to avoid any dislocation in financial markets that could stem from the war in Ukraine and to protect the transmission of monetary policy.  Inflation as an imported phenomenon The recent inflation data in the euro area do not make for easy reading. Headline inflation reached 5\\% in January and is expected to stay above 2\\% for the entire year, while core inflation is at 2.3\\%. Inflation pressures are becoming widespread (Chart 1).{[}2{]}  To determine how monetary policy should respond, we need to understand the drivers of this inflation spike. I have previously spoken about “good”, “bad” and “ugly” inflation in this context, and each of these has different implications for policy.{[}3{]}  In short, good inflation is driven by domestic demand and wages consistent with our target, which monetary policy should seek to nurture until that target is reached. Bad inflation instead reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices and depress economic activity, which monetary policy should look through. Ugly inflation – the worst type of inflation – is driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which monetary policy should immediately stamp out. Data indicate that bad inflation is still dominating in the euro area today.  Unlike in the United States, our economy is not experiencing excess domestic demand. Household nominal income has not recovered its pre-pandemic trend and households are saving more of their income than they did before the pandemic (Chart 2). Consumer spending and investment both remain well below their pre-crisis trends (Chart 3). Inflation is largely imported, reflecting global shocks to supply and demand that are spilling over to our economy through import prices (Chart 4, left panel).  Around 60\\% of inflation in January was energy, of which the euro area is a net importer (Chart 4, right panel). This is the consequence of the recent extraordinary increases in oil and gas prices (Chart 5, left panel). These in turn mainly reflect shocks that compress energy supply, rather than stronger aggregate demand (Chart 5, right panel). The rise in the cost of energy has further accelerated after the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Inflation is also being fuelled by the global shift in consumer spending from services to manufactured goods at a time when the pandemic has disrupted production. This has translated into global supply chain bottlenecks, high durable goods prices and strong pipeline pressures. This effect, which also represents a supply shock for the euro area, is now being reabsorbed, but at a different pace in different economies (Chart 6).  These global supply-driven increases in prices – above all energy and industrial goods, but also food – explain a good part of the currently high headline inflation (Chart 7, left panel).  In contrast, services inflation – the most domestic inflation component – has so far largely come from high-contact sectors (Chart 7, right panel). These sectors are experiencing frictions created by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and some of them (such as transport services) are also sensitive to energy prices.

Uncertainty in the inflation outlook Imported supply shocks that underpin bad inflation increase the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook in two main ways.  First, energy-driven inflation acts as a “tax”{[}4{]} on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. This adds to the uncertainty around the growth outlook, making it harder to judge when the economy is likely to reach full capacity. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was seeing a bounceback after the slowdown created by the Omicron wave. But we were still some way short of returning to our pre-crisis GDP trend, across a range of possible estimates (Chart 8). In my view, GDP reaching the bottom end of this range would be the bare minimum needed to conclude that resources are fully utilised{[}5{]} – and current projections suggest that this will not happen until the middle of 2023.  The terms of trade tax from higher energy prices could further delay the return to that growth path. The heavier energy bill has already reduced household purchasing power by around 2\\% (Chart 9, left panel) and is negatively affecting consumer confidence (Chart 9, right panel). It is also eroding the financial buffers built up during the pandemic, especially for households with low incomes, reducing the degree to which dissaving can support consumption in the future (Chart 10). Second, prolonged imported price shocks make it harder to assess whether inflation is feeding into domestic price pressures. The fact that core inflation is increasing above 2\\% may initially seem to suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are accumulating. However, rising core inflation is partly due to higher energy prices, which are pushing up costs in almost all sectors (Chart 11). Similarly, industrial goods inflation may remain elevated in the near term due to higher input costs, but beyond that its dynamics are hard to predict. Inventory levels are starting to return to normal, which suggests that demand might have peaked. The memory of supply shortages might prompt firms to build precautionary stocks that initially prolong tensions but ultimately lead to excess inventories once bottlenecks ease. This would amplify the manufacturing cycle and the volatility of goods inflation.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now intensifying this uncertainty.  We face greater financial volatility in the short term. There is a risk of renewed market dislocations as investors anticipate the potential impact of sanctions and possible retaliatory actions. And these dislocations might be felt unevenly, threatening the smooth transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. But we also face greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the medium term. The higher energy prices triggered by the conflict in Ukraine point to a longer period of above-target inflation, while supply disruptions of raw materials and food could prove more persistent{[}6{]}. At the same time, these factors increase the terms of trade tax and depress economic confidence, aggravating downside risks to growth and further delaying the return to full capacity.

Chart 9 Impact of “bad” inflation on demand    Sources: Left panel: ECB and ECB staff calculations; right panel: European Commission. Notes: Changes in purchasing power due to energy price fluctuations are computed as the year-on-year percentage change in the real price of energy, weighted by the nominal energy expenditure share (see Edelstein, P. and Kilian, L. (2009), “How sensitive are consumer expenditures to retail energy prices?”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 56, No 6, pp. 766-779). A negative value indicates a loss in consumer purchasing power.

Notes: The chart refers to average aggregate effects across the income distribution, to savings cut for those households that have positive savings and rely on them to face the shock, and to dissaving for households that do not have positive savings and thus rely on alternative sources, like accumulated savings or payment deferrals, to face the shock. In 2021 the perceived average price change for utilities was 11\\%, and for transport services it was 9\\%. The actual inflation rates for energy items could suffer from an underestimation bias in cases of rising prices because domestic energy consumption is billed with a delay. The latest observations are for January 2022.

The path to price stability This uncertainty means the path to price stability is exposed to pitfalls on both sides. As imported inflation now looks set to last longer, we will need to see wages catch up sufficiently to avoid a further fall in purchasing power. If that does not happen, we might face an adverse scenario of a slower closure of the output gap and renewed disinflationary pressures once bad inflation subsides. However, we could be also confronted with an opposite, equally adverse scenario where high inflation proves to be so persistent that it destabilises inflation expectations. That could feed into wage negotiations and domestic price pressures, entrenching inflation above our target.  Whether the economy can avoid these risks and move along a stable path depends crucially on our policy response. In such a finely balanced situation, any errant policy measure could easily push the economy onto the wrong path and put at risk what we have achieved so far. If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery. But if we are too timid in the face of mounting signs that inflation is becoming a domestic process, we might inadvertently give the impression that we lack determination to secure price stability.  In both scenarios, we should not infer the medium-term inflation outlook from present inflation figures. We need to carefully assess the prospects for wage growth, productivity growth and inflation expectations. This requires us to cross-check forward-looking indicators with evidence of what we can observe in the real economy. So far, the labour market is not looking excessively tight, especially in comparison with other jurisdictions (Chart 12, left panel), and even a significant increase in wage growth would not put it much above trend productivity growth plus our inflation target (Chart 12, right panel).{[}7{]} Wage growth has remained moderate to date{[}8{]}, perhaps reflecting workers’ concerns about job security, and the shock from the Ukraine conflict could prompt further caution. Different measures of inflation expectations also show no signs of de-anchoring on the upside (Charts 13 and 14).{[}9{]}  Therefore, the danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment. At the same time, I would like to see more evidence that improvements in labour markets are translating into wage growth consistent with our 2\\% target to be confident that the low-inflation scenario has fully disappeared. Indeed, a key conclusion of our strategy review was that, when coming out of a long period of low inflation, we should wait to see underlying inflation sufficiently advanced before adjusting policy, of which wages are a central component. And option-implied probabilities of tail events suggest that markets still see risks of eventually falling back into a too-low inflation regime.{[}10{]}  In the current situation, the task for the ECB is therefore twofold.  First, with the crisis in Ukraine raising uncertainty to unprecedented levels, our immediate priority is to protect the functioning of the financial sector and bolster confidence, in order to contain the impact of the shock on the economy and keep in place the conditions for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  Second, we should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps as the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer.

Note: Values were rounded to one decimal place prior to aggregation.    Accompanying the recovery with a light touch More than 40 years ago, William Brainard proposed the “conservatism principle”, which calls for cautious action when policymakers are faced with uncertainty.{[}11{]}  This principle does not apply to all forms of uncertainty. For example, when faced with deflationary shocks that risk rooting interest rates at the lower bound, it pays to act more decisively.{[}12{]} The same is true when inflation expectations are at risk of becoming de-anchored.{[}13{]} Both these considerations informed the ECB’s resolute response during the first phase of the pandemic.  And if measures to avoid market dislocations prove necessary in response to the war in Ukraine, we should intervene with equal determination, using all our instruments. In this respect, we reiterated in our February decisions that “within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability”. But when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policy on the economy, it is advisable to take small steps – and this is the case for the path out of the pandemic. Confronted with supply shocks that are both inflationary and contractionary, we should adjust our policy moderately and progressively as we receive feedback on the effects of our actions. We began reducing the pace of net asset purchases last year and we are on track to return to our pre-pandemic policy setting by September this year (Chart 15, left panel). Longer-term real yields have already returned to their pre-pandemic levels in the euro area (Chart 15, right panel).  The inflation outlook is stronger today than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, once the current crisis has abated, ensuring that monetary policy accompanies the recovery with a light touch may be consistent with a further adjustment in our net asset purchases. Beyond that, additional modifications to our stance should be considered carefully, for three main reasons.  First, in recent months euro area real yields have already risen more than in the United States, in spite of the different positions in the cycle (Chart 15, right panel). It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2\\% in a world of tighter financing conditions. This is especially important given that the equilibrium real interest rate is subject to large uncertainty (Chart 16), making it difficult to judge how far away we are from a neutral policy stance. Second, we need to be certain that removing accommodation too suddenly will not trigger market turmoil, as this could lead to financial markets overreacting and financing conditions tightening abruptly. This would set back the recovery in underlying inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at our target. We have already seen that, in the current environment, inflation expectations are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in the expected path of policy. Before the escalation of tensions in Ukraine, markets had brought forward their expectations of rate lift-off. This was associated with a reversal in the improvement of market-based inflation expectations (Chart 17, left panel).{[}14{]}  The fact that this decrease in inflation expectations was unique to the euro area{[}15{]} might have revealed concerns that the ECB would overreact to current inflation numbers and adjust its monetary policy too much and too quickly. These concerns were also hinted at by the shape of the €STR forward curve, which peaked in 2024 and then inverted somewhat, reflecting investors’ perceptions that the economy would be unable to sustain interest rates at those levels (Chart 17, right panel).  The end of net asset purchases in the euro area in 2018 was smooth mainly because short-term rates remained anchored by our forward guidance. We have not been in a situation before where markets are simultaneously reappraising the path of asset purchases and the path of rates, which could increase term premia along the yield curve. Moreover, markets are reappraising the tightening intentions of all major central banks at the same time, increasing the risk of undesirable spillovers on euro area financing conditions. Third, a key lesson from the previous crisis is not only that rates should not be raised prematurely, but also that doing so without the right framework in place can lead to renewed financial fragmentation. And this fragmentation could force monetary policy into a trade-off: we would face a choice between triggering an excessive tightening of financing conditions in some parts of the euro area, which would result in domestic demand that is too low, or adjusting the stance by less than would be optimal.  Today, fragmentation could result from the legacy effects of the pandemic, so we need a different mechanism for addressing it than during the financial crisis.{[}16{]} We have a framework that has served us well over the last two years, when the flexibility of our pandemic emergency purchase programme and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU instrument proved sufficient to stem fragmentation. This gives us a good indication of the direction we should now take. And we know from experience that the more credible a backstop is, the less likely it is to be used.

Faced with high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook with pitfalls on both sides, we should adjust policy carefully and recalibrate it as we see the effects of our decisions, so as to avoid suffocating the recovery and cement progress towards price stability.  That was already the case before the invasion of Ukraine, but this terrible event has made the need for prudence even greater. The world has become darker, and our steps should be smaller still.  At the ECB we stand by the people of Ukraine, who are now seeing what they hold dearest threatened by an unjustifiable act of aggression that violates the most fundamental principles of international law. That a country can be subjected to a full military invasion should steel our determination to defend those principles wherever we are, however we can.  The ECB’s role is clear: we will take any measures necessary, using all our instruments to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets. This is the duty of a central bank in times of emergency. And we will swiftly implement the sanctions decided on by the European Union. The scenes we have witnessed this past week will scar our memories forever. But I hope that, one day, we will look back on this moment and be proud that we did our duty, showed resolve and unity, and sought to uphold the universal values of peace, freedom and prosperity.    Brainard, W.C. (1967), “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 57, No 2, pp. 411-425. Around 60\\% of items in the inflation basket are currently above 2\\%, and the share of items that have seen price increases over the last three months is at a record high. Panetta, F. (2021a), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. The effect of higher energy prices is similar to that of a terms of trade tax that the euro area is paying to the rest of the world. See Panetta, F. (2021a), op. cit. Pre-crisis trends do not always represent the right benchmark for the recovery. The great financial crisis, for example, was created by excessive borrowing from the future which then had to be reabsorbed through a prolonged process of deleveraging. But the pandemic was a temporary exogenous shock which should not have significantly reduced the supply capacity of the economy. The pre-crisis growth path is therefore a reasonable standard. Panetta, F. (2021b), “Monetary autonomy in a globalised world”, welcome address at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world”, 26 April. For instance, Russia and Belarus produce large quantities of potash, Ukraine produces rare gases needed to produce lasers used in semi-conductor production, and Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of wheat. The ECB’s survey of large corporates paints a similar picture, foreseeing average wage increases to rise from around 2\\% in the recent past to 3\\% or more this year, although with significantly higher rates of wage growth in some sectors with labour shortages. See Gareis, J., Morris, R. and Roma, M. (2022), “Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies”, Economic Bulletin Issue 1, ECB. The average rate of negotiated wages growth was 1.5\\% in 2021 after 1.8\\% in 2020 as a whole, below our December projections. Consumers’ expectations, which arguably feed most directly into wage negotiations, show a distinct but temporary “hump” shape compared with January last year (the distribution in January 2022 shifts out for 1-year ahead expectations but shifts back in for 3-year ahead expectations, see Chart 13). Longer-term expectations are also becoming more concentrated around the 2\\% level compared with a year ago (Chart 14, left panel), while a growing number of monetary analysts see inflation stabilising at 2\\%, with only a small proportion seeing inflation above this target (Chart 14, right panel). Despite the surge in short-term inflation, recent research analysing the option-implied probabilities of tail events indicates that investors still fear the euro area may fall back into a deflationary trap in the future, whereas for the United States the opposite risk is higher. See Hilscher, J. Raviv Bar-Ilan, A. and Reis, R., (2022), How likely is an inflation disaster?, mimeo, London School of Economics, February. The paper also shows that in 2021 market perceptions of a high-inflation outcome rose significantly for the United States, but not for the euro area. These results (which estimate the tail probabilities for persistently very high or very low inflation using the prices of inflation options) reflect, among other things the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy regime. Brainard, W.C. (1967), —op. cit. In September 2020, for example, I made the argument that “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.” See Panetta, F. (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September. Söderström, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with Uncertain Parameters,” The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No 1, pp. 125-145. This fall is also visible in measures adjusted for risk premia at shorter horizons. In the United States and the United Kingdom measures of inflation expectations have remained broadly unchanged in recent weeks. In the past, the issue was resolved with an instrument – the Outright Monetary Transactions – designed for a situation where the main driver of fragmentation was unsound national policies, for which macroeconomic adjustment programmes were designed.\\\\\n",

This is a sad day for Europe and the world. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. In such times of extreme uncertainty, central banks need to be a source of confidence and a reliable anchor for the economy. Therefore, we are monitoring the situation closely. My remarks today reflect the macroeconomic situation predating the war. In the euro area, inflation has proven more persistent and more broad-based than expected, labour market slack is being reabsorbed at a faster pace than anticipated and pipeline pressures continue to build up. At the same time, prospects are rising that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may herald a turning point in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this environment, monetary policy needs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices today will not jeopardise price stability over the medium term. Households and firms count on the ECB to protect their purchasing power without putting at risk the current strong recovery from the crisis. Our policy framework enables us to deliver on these expectations. Our forward guidance has explicitly defined the conditions that need to be met for policy rates to be raised. And the clear sequence with which we intend to remove monetary stimulus, if and when necessary, reduces the uncertainty about how our actions will affect financing conditions and the broader economy. In the following, I will first discuss the current outlook for inflation. I will then explain the sequencing of policy measures that we will take once the Governing Council judges that policy should be normalised and will elaborate in more detail on three aspects that are more specific to the euro area. The first regards the question as to how the inflation outlook affects the policy normalisation process. The second point relates to how the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area affects the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. And the third point provides thoughts on how our sequence may interact with conditions in sovereign bond markets and the risks of fragmentation. A qualitative and quantitative change in the euro area’s inflation outlook A year ago, there was a widely shared expectation that inflation would rise sharply in response to the reopening of our economies but would subside swiftly as the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic would fade. There was a strong conviction that the combination of statistical base effects, slowing energy price inflation and the removal of one-off tax effects would mark a turning point in the euro area’s inflation trajectory towards the end of last year. These expectations have been disappointed. Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) continued to increase both in December 2021 and in January 2022, when it reached a new historical high of 5.1\\% (Slide 2). In January, euro area inflation surprised to the upside for the seventh consecutive month. Today, inflation is not only higher than expected, but price pressures are also visibly broadening. Measures of underlying inflation are following an unprecedented upward trend (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The prices of around two-thirds of the goods and services included in the HICP are currently increasing at an annual rate above 2\\% (Slide 3, right-hand chart). Less than a year ago, this share was close to 20\\%. Current measured inflation would be even higher if the costs of owner-occupied housing were included. Residential real estate prices continued to increase at an alarming pace. In the third quarter of 2021, prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 9\\% year-on-year, an unprecedented rate of increase (Slide 4, left-hand chart). If owner-occupied housing were included in the HICP, headline inflation in the third quarter of 2021 would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. For core inflation, the difference would have been twice as much – that is, core inflation would have been 2\\% rather than 1.4\\%, which is the largest difference observed since the start of the sample in 2012 (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Looking forward, the broad-based nature of recent upward surprises, extending well beyond the energy component, implies that significant uncertainty remains as to when the inflation peak will eventually be reached. What is becoming increasingly clear is that inflation is unlikely to fall back below our 2\\% target this year. It may increase even further over the near term before declining gradually over the course of 2022 as energy price inflation should slow. But the decline is not going to be nearly as fast as we previously anticipated. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2\\% target from above, rather than from below. The start of the year has seen three broad developments that corroborate this view. From pandemic to endemic? First, there are growing signs that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may bring forward the transition towards an endemic equilibrium. Although hospitalisations are still increasing in some countries alongside elevated case counts, admissions to intensive care units and fatality rates are now only a fraction of what they were in previous waves. There is a real chance that the Omicron variant could herald an inflection point after which the global community will be able to live with COVID-19 in spite of possible recurrent episodes of high case numbers. As governments worldwide are easing contact restrictions, the remaining slack in the economy will likely be reabsorbed at a faster pace than previously anticipated, in particular in contact-intensive services where the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on business and sentiment.  The most recent survey data corroborate this view for the euro area. In February, sentiment in the services sector improved sharply, back to levels seen before the discovery of the Omicron variant. A faster and more frontloaded recovery, in turn, risks increasing pressure on wages at a time when the labour market in the euro area is already showing first signs of strain. This brings me to the second point – the recovery in the labour market.  Strong recovery in the labour market Although the pandemic is still raging through the economy, slack in the labour market has continued to decline at a notably faster pace than projected (Slide 5, left-hand chart). A year ago, our central forecast was that the euro area unemployment rate would decline, on average, to 8.1\\% in 2022. In December 2021, the unemployment rate stood already at 7\\%. We are currently witnessing the strongest labour market in the history of the single currency. The unemployment rate is at a record low and below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), while the participation rate is at a record high (Slide 5, right-hand chart). Broader labour market slack, too, for which data are lagging, was already reabsorbed, by and large, by the end of the summer of last year, as strong demand is bringing more and more people – also those at the fringes of the labour market – back into work.{[}1{]}  While total hours worked still remained below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, there are good reasons to believe that the widespread easing of contact restrictions will help accelerate progress on that front too. Survey evidence confirms the picture of a tightening labour market. A rapidly rising share of firms across all economic sectors report shortages of labour as a factor limiting production. This is now the case for about a quarter to a third of all firms, a level never before observed in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand chart). Vacancy rates across the euro area are significantly higher than before the pandemic, which is consistent with firms reporting continued strong employment demand ahead (Slide 6, right-hand chart). These developments will add to pressure on wages as our economies continue to reopen. Although negotiated wage growth remains moderate, our latest corporate telephone survey among larger firms showed that wage pressures are expected to build up fast. Euro area firms anticipate considerably higher wage increases in the near term. For 2022, their average expected wage increase is 3.5\\%. The survey also showed that higher input costs, such as wages, are being passed through to consumer prices at a faster pace and to a larger extent than in the past, as strong pent-up demand creates a favourable environment for protecting or boosting profit margins. A faster pass-through, in turn, implies that for medium-term price pressures it is less relevant how fast wages expand today than how fast they will grow this year and next. Pipeline pressures remain elevated Third, pipeline pressures, which affect consumer price inflation with a lag, continue to build up. Import price inflation for intermediate and final consumer goods has increased further and remains at extraordinarily high levels (Slide 7, left-hand chart). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation reached a new all-time high in November. The inflation rate of services producer prices, which are an important element in the cost structure of both manufacturing and services firms, stands at 4.3\\%, which is almost nine times as high as its historical average. All services sectors report stronger price pressures than before the pandemic. These pipeline pressures will fade only gradually and will likely remain a source of upward pressure for consumer prices over the foreseeable future, with most firms expecting unusual cost pressures to persist for at least another six months. In addition, in large parts of the euro area the recent surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices will only be passed through to consumer prices with a lag. There is also a lot of uncertainty whether energy inflation will decline to the extent suggested by the futures curves underlying our December projections (Slide 7, right-hand chart). Brent oil spot prices are now at their highest levels since 2014 and current futures curves are well above the levels seen at the end of last year. Gas futures prices, too, are markedly higher than in December of last year. While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.{[}2{]}  In the EU, price developments under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) signal such an impending structural shift. ETS prices have recently reached a new record high of around €90 per tonne of carbon, almost three times as high as at the beginning of 2021, and they are expected to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. It is a reminder of the challenges we are facing in anticipating potential structural shifts in the underlying inflation process that could extend well beyond the energy sector.{[}3{]}  Sequencing of policy normalisation in the euro area All in all, there have been few instances in the recent past where the information set available to policymakers has changed so profoundly and in such a short period of time as has been the case since the beginning of the year. How today’s attack on Ukraine changes the euro area outlook is highly uncertain at this stage. We are monitoring the situation closely and will carefully evaluate the consequences for our policies. Based on the macroeconomic situation predating the war, however, inflationary pressures will likely prove stronger and more persistent over both the near and the medium term. Policy optionality is therefore needed more than ever to protect price stability.{[}4{]}  Our decisions in December of last year to end net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and to recalibrate the path of future purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) have been a first important step in this direction. At our next meeting in March, we will reassess whether the current path of asset purchases remains consistent with the updated inflation outlook, and we will thoroughly evaluate the progress made towards meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. While both the calibration and the time of adjustment of our policy instruments are data-dependent, the sequence with which we intend to adjust our policy stance is not. Our sequencing is subject to three guideposts. The first is our rate forward guidance, which provides the anchor for the normalisation process. It defines three conditions that need to be satisfied in the view of the Governing Council for our key policy rates to be raised: first, inflation reaching 2\\% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon; second, inflation remaining around 2\\% durably for the rest of the projection horizon; and, third, realised progress in underlying inflation being consistent with our inflation target. The second guidepost is that we will stop net asset purchases under the APP “shortly before” we increase our main policy rates. “Shortly before” is a term that is deliberately vague. It does not indicate a pre-defined distance between the end of our net asset purchases and policy rate lift-off. It does, however, imply that we will end net asset purchases under the APP once we judge that it is sufficiently likely that the rate forward guidance criteria are going to be fulfilled over the foreseeable future, while rates are going to be raised only when these conditions are actually met. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key policy rates. Again, the notion of an “extended period” is kept open to leave sufficient optionality in order to be able to respond to changes in the inflation outlook. In principle, this sequence is not very different from the one adapted by many other central banks, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. It defines a clear succession of steps that leaves sufficient flexibility to adjust the length of time needed before activating the next step of the sequence. That said, there are three considerations that are more specific to the euro area. Adjusting policy when inflation is converging to target The first relates to the inflation outlook. A central bank that faces a significant risk of inflation being markedly above target over the medium term would need to initiate a rapid sequence of policy rate hikes to above their estimated neutral levels. According to survey and market-based proxies, this would require bringing policy rates well into positive territory (Slide 8). However, these are not the conditions that we are facing today.  Rather, the economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2\\% target over the medium term. The current inflation outlook therefore calls for a gradual normalisation of our policy stance, reflecting the significant progress made towards meeting our inflation target in the future. During such a process of gradual normalisation, the focus should be first on unwinding step-by-step the exceptional measures we took to fight low inflation, starting with net asset purchases. The degree to which policy will need to be adjusted over time depends on how the inflation outlook continues to evolve. The focus on ending net asset purchases first reflects, at least in part, the fact that their side effects tend to increase over time.{[}5{]}  The experience of the past few years demonstrates, for example, that balance sheet policies have a significantly larger impact on house prices than changes in short-term policy rates, thereby contributing to the measurable rise in residential real estate prices (Slide 9).{[}6{]}  Similarly, years of balance sheet expansion have caused the bond free float in some economies to decline to very low levels (Slide 10, left-hand chart). As such, an end to net asset purchases enhances the availability of safe assets that the market requires to function well (Slide 10, right-hand chart).{[}7{]}  Ending net asset purchases when inflation is robustly converging to our target also credibly underlines that our actions are solely guided by our mandate, refuting concerns about fiscal dominance. Finally, in the current environment of large imported inflation, reversing the current exceptional measures has the potential to mitigate inflationary pressures even without the usual long lag in policy transmission. Over the past years, these measures have contributed to large capital outflows from the euro area, thereby putting downward pressure on the euro exchange rate (Slide 11). The exit from these measures can thus support the currency and, for a net importer of energy, provide tangible and immediate support to euro area households and firms by improving the terms of trade. Choice of policy instruments The second aspect relates to the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. This choice crucially depends on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The euro area remains a bank-based economy. Although market-based debt financing has gained importance since the global financial crisis, bank credit remains by far the dominant source of external finance for euro area firms (Slide 12, left-hand chart).{[}8{]}  The financing structure, in turn, has important implications for how strongly a given monetary impulse is transmitted to the real economy. Recent ECB staff analysis finds that when the share of bank loans in total external finance is high, like in the euro area, real GDP growth often shows only a weak response to changes in long-term interest rates (Slide 12, right-hand chart). In other words, our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process. Most of firms’ credit is either linked directly to short-term rates in financial markets, such as the EURIBOR, or has fixed maturities of short duration. Half of outstanding loans to euro area firms have a maturity of one year or less. Long-term rates are not only less relevant for policy transmission, central banks also have only indirect control over the part that is not related to the expected future path of short-term interest rates, i.e. the term premium.  The latter is affected by a host of factors, such as inflation uncertainty, global spillovers or demand by price-insensitive investors. The stock of bonds held by central banks is just one of these factors. Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance. This is also why our sequence foresees that policy lift-off will predate with some distance a reduction of our balance sheet. Risks of fragmentation This brings me to my third consideration – the question as to whether and how changes in sovereign bond market conditions could challenge our sequencing. Despite significant progress in recent years, the euro area’s institutional architecture remains incomplete. In the absence of a common fiscal capacity, and with public debt at elevated levels owing to the pandemic, parts of the euro area remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. There are three mitigating factors at present, however. One is that the combination of a long period of historically low rates and the marked increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt has measurably reduced the sensitivity of debt to changes in market interest rates. The average interest rate will remain low for some time even if the marginal interest rate starts rising (Slide 13, left-hand chart). Second, with average interest rates remaining low, and inflation receding only gradually, the strong expected recovery over the coming years should lead to a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios (Slide 13, right-hand chart). Structural reforms and large-scale investments related to Next Generation EU should foster confidence in the capacity of euro area countries to generate sustained high growth. Third, our decision in December last year to reinvest flexibly under the PEPP provides a strong mechanism to preserve the transmission of monetary policy in the event of severe and self-fulfilling market dislocations that would jeopardise the achievement of our mandate. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter renewed negative shocks related to the pandemic. Hence, we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation, while our monetary policy stance is guided by our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Conclusion Let me conclude. The inflation outlook has firmed since the start of the year. Inflationary pressures have broadened and have become more persistent. The expected easing of contact restrictions, together with the strong recovery in the labour market and elevated pipeline pressures have increased upside risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, the shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook. In this environment, we need to carefully reflect on how much monetary policy stimulus is required for inflation to stabilise at our target over the medium term, so as to neither fall below 2\\% once the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic fade, nor to allow an extended period of high inflation to become entrenched over time. This uncertainty speaks in favour of a gradual and data-dependent normalisation that respects the sequence that we have communicated, with a view to reducing uncertainty about our actions and intentions.

It is more than 30 years now since the first Anti-money Laundering Directive was published in June 1991. Since then, the framework has undergone many improvements, with the previous – fifth – AML Directive being published in May 2018.  The framework grew both in terms of the number and the forms of the regulatory instruments involved, incorporating both regulations and directives, as well as regulatory technical standards and guidelines developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Market Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. Nevertheless, the AML Directive has remained the core of the legal framework.  The ECB provided opinions on many of those legislative proposals. The ECB does not and cannot have any mandate to exercise anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. However, as my ECB Supervisory Board colleague Edouard Fernandez-Bollo aptly articulated in a recently published blog post: “Some things matter to you, even if you are not directly responsible for them.”  The EU AML/CFT framework affects the ECB’s tasks relating to the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the tasks that fall within its central banking mandate.  In particular, it is important for the ECB to factor the outcomes of AML/CFT supervision into its prudential supervisory processes. The risk of the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing is relevant for ECB prudential supervisory decisions on acquisitions of qualifying holdings in supervised entities, granting and withdrawing authorisations to credit institutions, and suitability assessments of existing or prospective managers of supervised entities. The outcomes of AML/CFT supervision are also reflected in day-to-day supervision as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.  Since the exchange of confidential information between the ECB and the AML/CFT supervisors was enabled in 2018 by an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, the ECB, as a prudential supervisor, has concluded an agreement on information exchange with more than 50 AML/CFT supervisory authorities across all Members States of the European Economic Area. This cooperation was further enhanced by subsequent amendments to the Directive in 2019, as well as by the establishment of AML/CFT colleges, in which the ECB participates as an observer. Over the past years the ECB has also been actively contributing to the work of the EBA’s AML Standing Committee. Good and efficient cooperation with AML/CFT supervisory authorities is therefore an important priority for us. Last year, following discussions in the Council of the EU, the Commission presented a set of legislative proposals for major changes to the EU AML/CFT framework: The first substantial change consists in transforming most of the requirements addressed to private entities from the AML Directive to a directly applicable EU regulation.  The second, and even more fundamental change is the establishment of a new authority at the EU level with a mandate for both direct and indirect AML/CFT supervision across all EU Member States. We see this as an important shift which has the potential to bring a more harmonised application of EU AML/CFT requirements and convergence of practices in AML/CFT supervision across the EU.  The third and most prominent change, which concerns the ECB’s central banking activities, is the introduction of an EU-wide limit to payments in cash. This type of measure has so far only been implemented at the level of individual Member States by means of national legislation. In the past the ECB has opined on a number of such national legislative measures. The legislative package published by the Commission consists of four legislative acts. The ECB was consulted on most elements of the legislative package by the European Parliament and the Council in October 2021. The ECB Governing Council recently adopted and published its opinions on all four elements of the package. My colleagues will give more details on the main themes which the ECB opinions touch upon. Most of the observations and suggestions in the ECB opinions seek to improve the framework of cooperation and information exchange with the future AML Authority, as well as the national AML/CFT authorities.  The ECB incorporated in its opinions its experience from establishing EU-level prudential supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, to the extent that it could be useful in establishing the EU-level AML/CFT supervision. I would like to highlight that the criteria for identifying the selected entities that will be under the direct supervision of the future AML Authority are relatively strict. The Commission envisages that only between 12 and 20 obliged entities will meet these criteria. Based on its experience, the ECB would strongly support amending these criteria such that a wider pool of obliged entities would be directly supervised by the AML Authority, including entities headquartered in each Member State. This would promote a common supervisory culture and convergence of AML/CFT supervisory practices.  Also, considering the strict, risk-based nature of the selection criteria, the publication of the list of selected obliged entities would be tantamount to indirectly disclosing the high money laundering risk status of selected supervised entities, sending unintended signals to the markets or creating reputational issues for selected obliged entities directly supervised by the new AML authority.  The most prominent element of the ECB opinions is the analysis of the proposed limit to cash payments. While the proposed limit of €10,000 euro does not appear problematic, the ECB brings several considerations to the attention of the co-legislators with a view to protecting the legal tender status of euro banknotes, in line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU.  Let me now hand over to my colleagues who will present the ECB opinions in greater detail.

And thank you to the Chair of the panel for allowing me to open the discussion with some remarks on the importance of transition planning. I fully appreciate the irony of what I’m about to say, what with you in Paris and me here on-screen, but we are all on the path to Paris. Citizens, firms, banks and prudential supervisors alike are working towards the climate goals agreed in 2015 as the EU and national governments roll out policies implementing the Paris Agreement.  In previous speeches, I have stressed the need for banks to put in place transition plans compatible with EU policies implementing the Paris Agreement – plans with concrete intermediate milestones to enhance banks’ long-term strategies and decision-making. More and more banks are already doing this themselves, while the European Commission also called for enhanced transition planning in its sustainable finance strategy published in July 2021.  For ECB Banking Supervision, the main concern that needs to be addressed by these transition plans is the level of banks’ risk exposures and the effectiveness of their controls. Have the exposures been sufficiently mitigated and are they prudent? As climate-related and environmental risks become increasingly widespread and more material, banks will, inevitably, be exposed to them, through both physical and transition risks. Banks therefore need adequate risk mitigation measures in place. This is what we need to assess as the prudential supervisor.  Introducing a legal requirement for banks to have a clear, detailed and prudent transition plan in place would increase the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory framework and contribute to maintaining a level playing field. Needless to say, we are very happy to see that this is exactly what the European Commission has proposed in its review of the Capital Requirements Directive, which is now with the co-legislators.  But it doesn’t stop there. For banks to be able to manage their transition risks adequately, they need to have information on how their customers are performing relative to a Paris-aligned transition path. This is where the European Commission’s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive comes in. The ECB welcomed this proposed directive in a legal opinion and it is now awaiting approval by the co-legislators.  The current standards on sustainability disclosure are insufficient to ensure that sustainability-related financial risks are properly understood and priced by market participants. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is a necessary step to address the gaps that currently hinder the development of appropriate sustainability policy, risk assessment and risk monitoring frameworks for the financial sector. This is because it will not only explicitly ask large banks to disclose their transition plans, it will also ask banks’ corporate clients to do the same. This last point is crucial, as it will enable banks to assess the climate-related and environmental risks in their asset portfolios. These disclosures are therefore an important element in ensuring that banks manage all material risks, in line with what we as the prudential supervisor expect them to do.  The climate-and-environmental puzzle is still highly complicated, but we can now see the pieces slotting into place. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the elements included in the Commission’s proposals are implemented in actual binding legislation entering into force without undue delay. This will smooth the path to Paris for all.

Throughout history, money and payments have been constantly evolving. And this also holds true in the digital age. As we increasingly pay digitally and shop online, we rely less on cash. Our wallets are gradually moving from our pockets to smartphones and other electronic devices.  These changes have profound implications for the nature of money itself, raising the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies for retail use.  Today I will argue that in a digital world CBDCs are necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilising force at the heart of the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty.  But CBDCs will need to be carefully designed. To be successful, they will need to add value for users, support competition rather than crowd out private innovation, and avoid risks to financial intermediation.  Why we need central bank digital money Our monetary system is based on the complementarity of private money with public money – which is available for retail payments in the form of banknotes.{[}1{]}  Confidence in private means of payment is determined by our ability to convert private money into safe public money. This is because central bank money is a risk-free form of money that is guaranteed by the State: by its strength, its credibility, its authority.  Other types of money are liabilities of private issuers: their value is based on the soundness of the issuer and is underpinned by the promise of one-to-one convertibility with central bank money.{[}2{]} Our readiness to hold private money such as bank deposits reflects the confidence that we can always go to a branch or a cash machine and convert our deposits into cash. The fact that we can do this tells us that our deposits are safe. It reassures us that we will be able to convert them into risk-free central bank money in the future, too.  Bank runs and financial crises start when confidence in the convertibility of private money evaporates.{[}3{]} Without the anchor of sovereign money, people would constantly have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money. This would undermine confidence in the singleness of money and impair the functioning of the payments system.{[}4{]}  History provides examples for this. In times when various forms of private money coexisted in the absence of sovereign money – such as the free banking era of the 19th century – the notes issued by banks often traded at variable prices{[}5{]} and instability risks{[}6{]} required dominant banks and clearinghouses to act as quasi-central banks{[}7{]}. The consensus among central banks on the coexistence between public and private money was summarised 20 years ago as follows: “The composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency. In other words, central banks would accept neither an outcome in which central bank money crowds out private initiative, nor an outcome in which central bank money is phased out by a market mechanism.”{[}8{]}  In the digital age, however, banknotes could lose their role as a reference value in payments, undermining the integrity of the monetary system.{[}9{]} Central banks must therefore consider how to ensure that their money can remain a payments anchor in a digital world.  Some have suggested that innovative private payment solutions such as stablecoins could, if properly regulated, make CBDCs superfluous.{[}10{]} However, confidence in stablecoins would also depend on the ability to convert them into central bank money,{[}11{]} unless stablecoin issuers were allowed to invest the reserve assets in risk-free deposits at the central bank. But this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money, which would endanger monetary sovereignty.{[}12{]} Moreover, in the absence of public money, stablecoins could exacerbate the “winner-takes-all” dynamics inherent in payment markets, with adverse consequences for the functioning of the payments system.{[}13{]} And stablecoins’ potentially large investments in safe assets could affect the availability of these assets.{[}14{]} This could in turn have an impact on market functioning and real interest rates, with undesirable implications from a monetary policy perspective.{[}15{]}  Other threats to monetary sovereignty could emerge in the absence of a domestic digital currency. If a foreign CBDC were to be widely adopted, this could lead to digital currency substitution{[}16{]}. This risk would be higher for small countries with unstable currencies and weak fundamentals, especially if the CBDC were issued in a major economy.{[}17{]} But it could eventually also affect leading currencies.{[}18{]}  Such risks are not imminent, but they should not be underestimated. Just as the US dollar overtook the pound sterling as the leading reserve currency within only a decade of the end of the First World War,{[}19{]} digital innovation may give rise to powerful new foreign contenders, with disruptive consequences for those markets that are not prepared to face the digital challenge.  The widespread adoption of a foreign CBDC would increase the risk of financial transactions being based on technologies managed and supervised elsewhere, with limited oversight by domestic authorities. A system of this kind may not have sufficient safeguards against external threats, including cyber threats. It could put the confidential data of people, businesses, and states at greater risk of being misused. And it could make the information needed to counter criminal activities harder to trace.  The scenario I am describing is not one of science fiction. It is already the case in the market for crypto-assets, which are widely used for criminal activities.{[}20{]} A similar situation might affect other digital asset markets in the future. So the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted, and this will make a big difference.{[}21{]} But it may not be sufficient.  The main benefits of CBDCs  A CBDC would preserve the coexistence of sovereign and private money in a digital world. This is not an abstract benefit – it is the basis for financial and monetary stability, ensuring competition and efficiency in payment markets. But a CBDC could generate even more benefits for users.  It could improve the confidentiality of digital payments. The information contained in electronic transactions can be monetised by private companies{[}22{]}, posing a threat to privacy. This risk is further compounded by big techs starting to offer financial services and by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Data protection regulation aims to prevent misuse, but cannot always keep pace with technological innovation, as we have seen in past cases of data breaches and misuse by tech companies.{[}23{]}  If a digital currency were offered by an independent public institution such as the central bank – which has no interest in exploiting individual payment data for any purpose – it could enhance, not reduce, the confidentiality of electronic payments. Potential users clearly want this: when we consulted the public on the topic, privacy was identified as the most important aspect of a digital euro.{[}24{]} Sound governance arrangements that comply with data protection regulations would ensure that payment information is only accessed for permitted purposes, such as countering illegal activities. We are cooperating with the relevant European authorities on this issue.  A digital euro would also increase choice and reduce costs, contributing to a level playing field in payments.{[}25{]} Key segments of the euro area payments market, such as cards and e-payments, are dominated by a handful of players, which strengthens their pricing power. Some estimates suggest that Europeans pay about 1.4\\% of GDP for payments services. In the United States, the costs are higher.{[}26{]}  One might argue that private service providers are already well equipped to offer low-cost digital payment solutions. However, the limited evidence available suggests that low-income households use digital payments less than high-income households. This is consistent with the hypothesis that digital payments remain expensive for many users.{[}27{]} And even in advanced financial systems, many citizens are “unbanked” or “underbanked”.{[}28{]} Although financial inclusion depends on several factors, such as financial and digital literacy, the cost of financial services is likely to play a role.  Our digital euro project comes with a commitment that all – including vulnerable population groups – will have access to safe public money in the digital era.  Designing a successful digital euro  The fact that CBDCs are necessary to guarantee the smooth functioning of the payments market does not mean that their success should be taken for granted. Users may lack incentives to fully appreciate such benefit and – given the vast supply of private digital monies – could show limited interest in CBDCs. Indeed, we face two opposite risks: being “too successful” and crowding out private payment solutions and financial intermediation, or being “not successful enough” and generating insufficient demand. We take both risks seriously.  To avoid interfering with the functioning of the financial system, we are considering how to make the digital euro a convenient medium of exchange but not an attractive form of investment. We are examining the pros and cons of introducing a quantitative cap on digital euro holdings{[}29{]} or a tiered remuneration that would disincentivise excessive holdings.{[}30{]} We are analysing the potential impact on monetary policy. To ensure that our digital currency would be a convenient means of payment, we are working to make it available within private payment solutions, so that people would be able to use it easily wherever they can pay digitally. We aim to level the playing field by allowing intermediaries – including small ones – to offer innovative solutions to their customers. And we are considering how a digital euro could improve financial inclusion. We are interviewing focus groups to identify the characteristics of a digital euro that would add value for users. And we are working on the technical options to reconcile different objectives such as the right of individuals to confidentiality versus the public interest in guaranteeing the transparency required to counter illegal activities; or the benefits of allowing the digital euro to be widely used versus the need to safeguard financial intermediation.  We have launched several work streams: on the design choices that can guarantee confidentiality, on the prioritisation of different use cases,{[}31{]} and on the business options for intermediaries{[}32{]}. We will cover areas such as cyber security and operational resilience.  We are interacting with all relevant stakeholders, from intermediaries to consumers, merchants and authorities. We are cooperating with the European Parliament, the European Commission and the finance ministers of the euro area countries. To get technical advice and collect a broad range of views on possible solutions, we have set up a Market Advisory Group{[}33{]} and are regularly discussing the project with the Euro Retail Payments Board{[}34{]}, academics and think tanks. Bearing in mind the international implications of CBDCs,{[}35{]} we are cooperating with other major central banks. In October 2021 we launched a two-year investigation phase to define the design features of the digital currency. At the end of 2023 we could decide to start a realisation phase to develop and test the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro, which could take three years. Only thereafter will we decide whether to actually issue a digital euro.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  For decades, the complementarity of public money and private money has guaranteed stability, competition and innovation.  The digitalisation of payments cannot be ignored by central banks, which have so far provided their money only in physical form. Central banks cannot escape these transformations, nor should they underestimate the potential for far-reaching shifts that may occur.  To ensure that public money maintains its fundamental role in the digital age, the ECB has launched an investigation into the possible issuance of a digital euro alongside cash.  The digital euro is an ambitious and complex project that can improve the efficiency of the economic and financial system. We want to make it a driver of stability and inclusive progress, capable of strengthening ties between economies and financial systems around the world. Our experience may provide useful insights for other central banks. And likewise, we are keen to learn from them. I am therefore pleased to exchange views with US experts, and I am now looking forward to our discussion.    Although central bank money can also take the form of reserves (deposits that commercial banks hold at the central bank), the focus of this speech will be on cash. One-to-one convertibility with central bank money is what makes the regulated forms of money convertible with each other and is why they are perceived as interchangeable when making payments. This does not mean that the safeguards put in place to protect savings – legislation and banking supervision, deposit insurance schemes, capital markets supervision – are not important. On the contrary. They must, however, be flanked by convertibility to ensure the smooth functioning of payments and the stability of the financial system. On the singleness of money see Bank for International Settlements (2003),  The role of central bank money in payment systems , Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, August. For instance, the notes of new banks were more heavily discounted. See Gorton, G. (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No 2, pp. 346-397. Price variability was inconvenient, as users had to consult a note reporter to monitor the value of the notes in circulation. See Eichengreen, B. (2019), “From Commodity to Fiat and Now to Crypto: What Does History Tell Us?”, NBER Working Paper Series, No 25426, January. The experience of the free banking era in the United States varied considerably among states and each had a significant number of problem banks. See Rolnick, A.J. and Weber, W.E. (1983), “New Evidence on the Free Banking Era”, American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No 5, pp. 1080-1091. In the United States, dominant banks disciplined note issuing banks by threatening them with bulk redemption of their notes, while clearinghouses regulated member bank levels of equity, reserves, and interest rates, audited members, produced money during crises and issued a form of insurance; See Gorton, G. (1985), “Banking theory and free banking history: A Review Essay”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 16(2), 267-276. See Bank for International Settlements (2003), op. cit. For an overview of the role of central bank money over the past 20 years, see Bindseil, U., and Terol, I (2020), “The evolving role of central bank money in payments”, Central Banking, 15 July. While banks could continue to hold central bank money in the form of reserves, this may not prove sufficient to fully preserve the monetary anchor role of central bank money. People would be unable to use central bank money as means of exchange and would thus have little incentive to hold it. This would weaken the unit of account role of sovereign money. If the currency is not demanded by the public, the mere announcement that the central bank would make it available would not be enough to preserve its role in the economy. In history, sovereign money was at times used as unit of account but not as a medium of exchange. This was for example the case of the livre, the “imaginary money” introduced by Charlemagne in the monetary reform of the eighth century, named after the libra (pound), the sovereign money introduced by the ancient King of Rome Servius Tullius in the sixth century BC. The livre was never coined and never circulated. However, it had a fixed conversion rate with another form of sovereign money, the denier (1 livre was equal to 240 deniers), which was actually coined and actively used as means of exchange.

The value of a stablecoin is linked to a portfolio of one or more other assets (the reserve assets), including currency in the form of commercial bank deposits. Stablecoins can therefore be low-risk but not risk-free. Risks increase if stablecoin arrangements are backed by risky or opaque assets, especially in times of market turmoil.

New players, including operating platforms with huge customer bases, can exploit network effects and economies of scale to build dominant positions, creating their own closed-loop ecosystems. They may exploit customer data for private scoring and other uses. They may erect barriers to impede interoperability and use their “coins” to displace other forms of money.

While the international role of a currency will continue to depend to a large extent on the fundamentals of the underlying economy, availability in CBDC form would facilitate use in cross-border payments by reducing frictions and costs. Model simulations suggest that the share of a country’s currency in global export payments increases when it is available as a CBDC, but continues to depend to a large extent on forces such as the size and the stability of the economy and the development and efficiency of the financial sector.

In the public consultation conducted by the ECB in 2020, 43\\% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of a digital euro, well ahead of other features. The other characteristics highlighted in the consultation were the security of payments and usability throughout the euro area, which were ranked first by 18\\% and 11\\% of those surveyed, respectively.

See McKinsey (2020),  The 2020 McKinsey Global Payments Report.  Based on the Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE), the preference for cash in the euro area is significantly higher among low-income respondents. While only 36\\% of those with an income of €1,000 per month or less have a preference for cards or other cashless means of payment, that preference was expressed by 61\\% in the income bracket of €2,500 and more. See Panetta, F. (2021), “Cash still king in times of COVID-19”, speech at the Deutsche Bundesbank’s 5th International Cash Conference on “Cash in times of turmoil”, 15 June. Although they are often invisible to the customer, the various layers of merchant fees can add up to some 3\\% of the transaction value. According to Glory Global Solutions, “Some banks tell merchants to budget for between 2.5\\% and 3\\% of the transaction valuable, but with so many variables, this is only ever a rough guide.” See Glory Global Solutions (2018),  Electronic Payments – Not As Cheap As You Think . In the United States, 6\\% of adults do not have a checking, savings, or money market account. See Federal Reserve (2019),  Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2018 - May 2019 . In the euro area there are still more than 5\\% of adults without a payment account. See World Bank (2017),  Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database  .  In the case of quantitative holding limits, we are considering waterfall solutions linking digital euro accounts to private money accounts, to allow payments in excess of the limit. Bindseil, U.

Use cases refer to the various interactions between people, businesses, Government and machines (e.g. payments at the point of sale, online, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, etc.). Business options are naturally related to costs (fees, devices), but can also include the front end, taking into account consumers’ preference to use the current payment methods, be it their smartphone, card or cash. A digital euro should provide a similar payment experience, while also considering future innovations like QR codes, which are becoming more and more popular.

Our focus today is the current state of C\\&E risk management practices in the banking sector, and the ECB’s upcoming thematic review of these risks. Over the last couple of years, we have launched several targeted actions in this direction. In 2020 we issued the ECB guide on C\\&E risks and in 2021 we conducted a supervisory review of banks’ approaches to managing these risks based on their own assessments. The ECB has progressively taken C\\&E risks into greater account in its supervision, as have banks in their business.  2022 will be the year that C\\&E risks become integrated in the day-to-day activities of our joint supervisory teams, who are in constant contact with banks. These risks will come to form an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with supervised entities and the supervisory review and evaluation process, the SREP. This will ultimately influence banks’ minimum capital requirements. The encompassing and integrated approach – which supervisors and banks are already very familiar with for traditional risk categories – is what I call the immersive supervisory approach to C\\&E risks. Along with the 2022 ECB supervisory stress test, the thematic review forms part of the ECB Banking Supervision roadmap to ensure that banks adequately incorporate C\\&E risk management. These supervisory activities complement the ECB’s broader C\\&E agenda, which includes publishing the results of an economy-wide climate change stress test, and our 2021 action plan to include climate change considerations in our monetary policy. The state of C\\&E risk management  Climate and environmental risks are impossible to avoid. The public knows it and the ECB knows it. The banks themselves now know it, as reflected in the outcome of their internal assessments. All banks that thoroughly assessed their exposure to C\\&E risks concluded that these risks are material. By contrast, not a single materiality assessment submitted by banks that reported no material risk exposure was deemed adequate. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the banks that acknowledged the materiality of the C\\&E risks they faced did so for both transition and physical risks. And they acknowledged that these risks are material in both the short and the long term. Despite this broad acknowledgement of the materiality of these risks, and thus the need to adequately manage them, we see that most banks still have a considerable way to go in developing their risk management capabilities. As the findings we published last year show, banks reported that 90\\% of their practices are only partially or not at all in line with ECB supervisory expectations. Let me repeat: 90\\%. This is both bad news and good news. Bad news because, at the time of their assessment, banks were a long way away from where they needed to be. But good news because half the banks we supervise already acknowledge that climate risks are an inevitable part of their day-to-day business. We therefore expect banks to analyse how C\\&E risks can or will affect their portfolios and products over the short, medium and long term, and under various scenarios, too. This type of forward-looking analysis of C\\&E risk should be basic practice, just as it would be for any other type of risk. Moreover, beyond merely formally attributing responsibilities, we still see banks making little progress towards more actively managing the C\\&E risks they face. Even certain banks that recognise the materiality of C\\&E risks have not reported any practices to either reduce or manage their level of risk. This year we want to see firm progress in how banks incorporate C\\&E risks in their risk management. In doing so, banks should adopt a strategic approach to managing these risks, using the full array of the risk management instruments at their disposal. This includes strategically realigning portfolios, setting clear risk appetites, developing mitigation strategies, adjusting qualitative credit criteria and quantifying and holding capital. Another key area in which banks can make progress is by actively supporting their clients in mitigating and adapting to the different types of climate and environmental risks. Moreover, banks can draw on the industry’s good practices that we shared last year in our report. In the face of data challenges and methodological uncertainties, banks have an even stronger imperative to get moving. To be clear, banks should not misconstrue the ECB’s actions as an outright call for divesting from carbon-intensive activities or from geographical regions vulnerable to physical risk. Rather, we are asking banks to fully grasp the physical and transition risks and to actively start managing them, with the aim of making their portfolios more resilient to C\\&E risks. Not all sectors will decarbonise overnight. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios show that certain sectors will continue to rely on carbon-intensive technologies for some time. We as prudential supervisors merely need banks to understand what the transition entails for their risk exposures to those sectors, and to reflect it in their overall risk management strategy. What we do not expect is an outright withdrawal from carbon-intensive industries, nor do we expect it to happen for every single sector or counterparty – but we do expect banks to harbour the capacity to manage the risks emerging from climate change. To draw a comparison with traditional risk exposures, we, as supervisors, would of course not expect banks to divest from all assets that entail credit risks, but we do insist that these risks are managed appropriately. C\\&E risks are to be managed just like any other risk; and their sound management requires sound risk controls. This is precisely one of our focus areas in the upcoming thematic review on C\\&E risks. Supervisory roadmap for C\\&E risks For several years, the ECB has identified banks’ exposure to C\\&E risks as one of the main vulnerabilities in the European banking sector. Assessing and helping banks address risks stemming from climate change and environmental degradation will be one of our supervisory priorities from now until 2024, albeit these risks have been on our minds for far longer. I remember giving my first speeches on this topic in late 2015 when still an executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank. So, we have already come a long way and our supervision of C\\&E risks will now take more concrete form. The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C\\&E risks.  The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C\\&E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the banks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front.  The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C\\&E risks, which is a key topic of the session today. Two years after we launched the supervisory guide on C\\&E risks, we are conducting this thematic review to follow up on the self-assessment exercise conducted last year. Our main goal will be to assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks’ C\\&E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C\\&E risk strategies and risk profiles. Do all banks’ processes and analyses have visible consequences? Does the way in which banks actually steer their balance sheets and risk profiles reflect the materiality of C\\&E risks? These will be some of the core questions of this review.  As part of this exercise, we will monitor banks’ alignment with the supervisory expectations set out in the guide, and encourage banks’ progress towards the industry’s best practices. Fortunately, those practices were identified across different European banks over the last two years. They show that some banks are already doing what we are asking. The ECB is doing its part by guiding banks in their climate journey, setting forth supervisory expectations and sharing updates on good practices in the industry. In light of the efforts banks have already made in devising their action plans, as well as all the information on this topic published to date – by both the ECB and several other public and private organisations we expect to see material progress in banks’ implementation deadlines and concrete actions.  As part of the thematic review, we will also be looking more closely at the risk management practices for environmental risks such as risks to biodiversity, water stress and pollution. All have similar features and warrant a coordinated approach. Banks can make significant savings if, taking advantage of the momentum, they extend the range of their preparations to cover all these risks, and are thus ready for a new, more concrete, supervisory and regulatory environment. Our benchmark from last year shows that, as of early 2021, very few banks were looking into environmental risks beyond climate. We have highlighted this gap to banks. This year, we will assess how banks are managing their exposures to environmental risks beyond climate and follow up accordingly.  As we build our joint supervisory teams’ capacity to help banks understand and incorporate C\\&E risks, our supervisors will treat these risks just like any other. Last year’s review was conducted by a central team of experts, with the joint supervisory teams conducting the follow-up dialogue with the bank. By contrast, this thematic review will be fully embedded in the work of every joint supervisory team. While still backed by a central team of experts, the review will be driven from the engine room of supervision. And this is where the supervision of C\\&E risks will stay. Following up on the thematic review, all banks under our direct supervision will receive comprehensive feedback setting out any shortcomings identified. Combined with the observations from the climate stress test, this will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. Targeted qualitative requirements may also be imposed. As part of the review, we will also carefully check whether banks have followed up on any requirements we issued last year. The thematic review is a full-on supervisory review. As such, we also have the full set of supervisory measures at our disposal to address shortcomings. Those banks that continue to fail to conduct a materiality assessment of C\\&E risks or have not followed-up on earlier requirements will start noticing just that. Regulatory and supervisory framework  The ECB is taking action under its mandate and under the current prudential framework to get banks to where they need to be in terms of incorporating C\\&E risks into their business. Our supervisory activities are thus keeping in line with the rapidly evolving regulatory and supervisory framework.  For example, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive proposed by the European Commission will further articulate the integration of C\\&E risks in the legal framework and will require banks to develop transition plans and supervisors to scrutinise them. This is the next important step in risk management, which I have mentioned on previous occasions, and which will require banks to look thirty years ahead and devise intermediate targets for their risk exposures that can render their risk management practices fit for an economy that will transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.  And finally, disclosure frameworks and taxonomies are also developing rapidly to create an information architecture to enable banks to manage the risks and scale up green finance. Both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have intensive work programmes to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework can better cater for climate-related risks. One concrete example is the EBA’s recently published implementing technical standards for the disclosure of Environmental Social and Governance risks, which also require large banks to start disclosing their alignment with the IEA pathways by June 2024 at the latest for all relevant portfolios. Banks are running out of time to complete their preparations. On all these fronts, the sooner banks act, the smoother the transition will be for them, and for the economy they help support.  Conclusion  For ECB Banking Supervision, 2022 marks the third year of dedicated C\\&E risk activities. First, we issued our guide with supervisory expectations. Next, we asked banks to share with us their self-assessments on how their practices match our expectations. And they have indeed been very open and candid in these self-assessments, for which I am truly grateful.  Together we have learnt that there is a lot of room for improvement. Considering the importance, urgency and long-lasting nature of climate change, we are asking banks to intensify their efforts in measuring and managing C\\&E risks in line with our expectations. With the exercises that we are conducting this year, the prudential supervision of climate-related risks is moving closer to maturity. The thematic review is the next step in fully immersing C\\&E risks in the work of the joint supervisory teams and marks key progress towards their integration in the SREP. It crystalises our commitment to ensuring that the prudential supervision of C\\&E risks is here to stay.

Across advanced economies, the current inflation spike is proving to be broader and more persistent than initially expected, leading central banks to reassess the risk that it could become entrenched. This is no easy task, especially in the euro area.  Economic conditions in the euro area have benefited from the strong response of monetary policy and its positive interactions with fiscal policy during the pandemic. But this is not a typical business cycle, and we are not seeing a typical recovery.  The current inflation spike is for the most part not being driven by domestic factors – by an economy that is “running hot”, in other words. Demand remains below its pre-crisis trend.  Instead, the economy is experiencing a series of imported supply shocks that are pushing up inflation and depressing demand. The exit from the pandemic is characterised by global mismatches between demand and supply – in energy and goods markets in particular – with uneven effects across sectors.  As a result, past economic regularities may be a poor guide for the future.  This makes medium-term developments extremely hard to anticipate. There are forces at play that could delay the recovery and contain underlying price pressures, and others that could lead to accelerating inflation. Policy mistakes in either direction could push the economy onto an unfavourable path.  Faced with such uncertainty, there is a case for the central bank to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps in adjusting policy, so as not to suffocate the as yet incomplete recovery.  If we are to durably escape the low inflation and low growth environment that has defined the past decade, we cannot afford to waste the progress we have made so far. In the spirit of William Brainard[1], we should take small steps in a dark room. The dramatic conflict in Ukraine is now weighing negatively on both supply and demand conditions, making uncertainty more acute and exacerbating risks to the medium-term inflation outlook on both sides. In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer. And the ECB stands ready to act to avoid any dislocation in financial markets that could stem from the war in Ukraine and to protect the transmission of monetary policy.  Inflation as an imported phenomenon The recent inflation data in the euro area do not make for easy reading. Headline inflation reached 5% in January and is expected to stay above 2% for the entire year, while core inflation is at 2.3%. Inflation pressures are becoming widespread (Chart 1).[2]  To determine how monetary policy should respond, we need to understand the drivers of this inflation spike. I have previously spoken about “good”, “bad” and “ugly” inflation in this context, and each of these has different implications for policy.[3]  In short, good inflation is driven by domestic demand and wages consistent with our target, which monetary policy should seek to nurture until that target is reached. Bad inflation instead reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices and depress economic activity, which monetary policy should look through. Ugly inflation – the worst type of inflation – is driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which monetary policy should immediately stamp out. Data indicate that bad inflation is still dominating in the euro area today.  Unlike in the United States, our economy is not experiencing excess domestic demand. Household nominal income has not recovered its pre-pandemic trend and households are saving more of their income than they did before the pandemic (Chart 2). Consumer spending and investment both remain well below their pre-crisis trends (Chart 3). Inflation is largely imported, reflecting global shocks to supply and demand that are spilling over to our economy through import prices (Chart 4, left panel).  Around 60% of inflation in January was energy, of which the euro area is a net importer (Chart 4, right panel). This is the consequence of the recent extraordinary increases in oil and gas prices (Chart 5, left panel). These in turn mainly reflect shocks that compress energy supply, rather than stronger aggregate demand (Chart 5, right panel). The rise in the cost of energy has further accelerated after the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Inflation is also being fuelled by the global shift in consumer spending from services to manufactured goods at a time when the pandemic has disrupted production. This has translated into global supply chain bottlenecks, high durable goods prices and strong pipeline pressures. This effect, which also represents a supply shock for the euro area, is now being reabsorbed, but at a different pace in different economies (Chart 6).  These global supply-driven increases in prices – above all energy and industrial goods, but also food – explain a good part of the currently high headline inflation (Chart 7, left panel).  In contrast, services inflation – the most domestic inflation component – has so far largely come from high-contact sectors (Chart 7, right panel). These sectors are experiencing frictions created by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and some of them (such as transport services) are also sensitive to energy prices.

Uncertainty in the inflation outlook Imported supply shocks that underpin bad inflation increase the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook in two main ways.  First, energy-driven inflation acts as a “tax”[4] on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. This adds to the uncertainty around the growth outlook, making it harder to judge when the economy is likely to reach full capacity. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was seeing a bounceback after the slowdown created by the Omicron wave. But we were still some way short of returning to our pre-crisis GDP trend, across a range of possible estimates (Chart 8). In my view, GDP reaching the bottom end of this range would be the bare minimum needed to conclude that resources are fully utilised[5] – and current projections suggest that this will not happen until the middle of 2023.  The terms of trade tax from higher energy prices could further delay the return to that growth path. The heavier energy bill has already reduced household purchasing power by around 2% (Chart 9, left panel) and is negatively affecting consumer confidence (Chart 9, right panel). It is also eroding the financial buffers built up during the pandemic, especially for households with low incomes, reducing the degree to which dissaving can support consumption in the future (Chart 10). Second, prolonged imported price shocks make it harder to assess whether inflation is feeding into domestic price pressures. The fact that core inflation is increasing above 2% may initially seem to suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are accumulating. However, rising core inflation is partly due to higher energy prices, which are pushing up costs in almost all sectors (Chart 11). Similarly, industrial goods inflation may remain elevated in the near term due to higher input costs, but beyond that its dynamics are hard to predict. Inventory levels are starting to return to normal, which suggests that demand might have peaked. The memory of supply shortages might prompt firms to build precautionary stocks that initially prolong tensions but ultimately lead to excess inventories once bottlenecks ease. This would amplify the manufacturing cycle and the volatility of goods inflation.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now intensifying this uncertainty.  We face greater financial volatility in the short term. There is a risk of renewed market dislocations as investors anticipate the potential impact of sanctions and possible retaliatory actions. And these dislocations might be felt unevenly, threatening the smooth transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. But we also face greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the medium term. The higher energy prices triggered by the conflict in Ukraine point to a longer period of above-target inflation, while supply disruptions of raw materials and food could prove more persistent[6]. At the same time, these factors increase the terms of trade tax and depress economic confidence, aggravating downside risks to growth and further delaying the return to full capacity.

Chart 9 Impact of “bad” inflation on demand    Sources: Left panel: ECB and ECB staff calculations; right panel: European Commission. Notes: Changes in purchasing power due to energy price fluctuations are computed as the year-on-year percentage change in the real price of energy, weighted by the nominal energy expenditure share (see Edelstein, P. and Kilian, L. (2009), “How sensitive are consumer expenditures to retail energy prices?”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 56, No 6, pp. 766-779). A negative value indicates a loss in consumer purchasing power. The latest observations are for January 2022.

Notes: The chart refers to average aggregate effects across the income distribution, to savings cut for those households that have positive savings and rely on them to face the shock, and to dissaving for households that do not have positive savings and thus rely on alternative sources, like accumulated savings or payment deferrals, to face the shock. In 2021 the perceived average price change for utilities was 11%, and for transport services it was 9%. The actual inflation rates for energy items could suffer from an underestimation bias in cases of rising prices because domestic energy consumption is billed with a delay. The latest observations are for January 2022.

The path to price stability This uncertainty means the path to price stability is exposed to pitfalls on both sides. As imported inflation now looks set to last longer, we will need to see wages catch up sufficiently to avoid a further fall in purchasing power. If that does not happen, we might face an adverse scenario of a slower closure of the output gap and renewed disinflationary pressures once bad inflation subsides. However, we could be also confronted with an opposite, equally adverse scenario where high inflation proves to be so persistent that it destabilises inflation expectations. That could feed into wage negotiations and domestic price pressures, entrenching inflation above our target.  Whether the economy can avoid these risks and move along a stable path depends crucially on our policy response. In such a finely balanced situation, any errant policy measure could easily push the economy onto the wrong path and put at risk what we have achieved so far. If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery. But if we are too timid in the face of mounting signs that inflation is becoming a domestic process, we might inadvertently give the impression that we lack determination to secure price stability.  In both scenarios, we should not infer the medium-term inflation outlook from present inflation figures. We need to carefully assess the prospects for wage growth, productivity growth and inflation expectations. This requires us to cross-check forward-looking indicators with evidence of what we can observe in the real economy. So far, the labour market is not looking excessively tight, especially in comparison with other jurisdictions (Chart 12, left panel), and even a significant increase in wage growth would not put it much above trend productivity growth plus our inflation target (Chart 12, right panel).[7] Wage growth has remained moderate to date[8], perhaps reflecting workers’ concerns about job security, and the shock from the Ukraine conflict could prompt further caution. Different measures of inflation expectations also show no signs of de-anchoring on the upside (Charts 13 and 14).[9]  Therefore, the danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment. At the same time, I would like to see more evidence that improvements in labour markets are translating into wage growth consistent with our 2% target to be confident that the low-inflation scenario has fully disappeared. Indeed, a key conclusion of our strategy review was that, when coming out of a long period of low inflation, we should wait to see underlying inflation sufficiently advanced before adjusting policy, of which wages are a central component. And option-implied probabilities of tail events suggest that markets still see risks of eventually falling back into a too-low inflation regime.[10]  In the current situation, the task for the ECB is therefore twofold.  First, with the crisis in Ukraine raising uncertainty to unprecedented levels, our immediate priority is to protect the functioning of the financial sector and bolster confidence, in order to contain the impact of the shock on the economy and keep in place the conditions for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  Second, we should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps as the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer.

Note: Values were rounded to one decimal place prior to aggregation.    Accompanying the recovery with a light touch More than 40 years ago, William Brainard proposed the “conservatism principle”, which calls for cautious action when policymakers are faced with uncertainty.[11]  This principle does not apply to all forms of uncertainty. For example, when faced with deflationary shocks that risk rooting interest rates at the lower bound, it pays to act more decisively.[12] The same is true when inflation expectations are at risk of becoming de-anchored.[13] Both these considerations informed the ECB’s resolute response during the first phase of the pandemic.  And if measures to avoid market dislocations prove necessary in response to the war in Ukraine, we should intervene with equal determination, using all our instruments. In this respect, we reiterated in our February decisions that “within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability”. But when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policy on the economy, it is advisable to take small steps – and this is the case for the path out of the pandemic. Confronted with supply shocks that are both inflationary and contractionary, we should adjust our policy moderately and progressively as we receive feedback on the effects of our actions. We began reducing the pace of net asset purchases last year and we are on track to return to our pre-pandemic policy setting by September this year (Chart 15, left panel). Longer-term real yields have already returned to their pre-pandemic levels in the euro area (Chart 15, right panel).  The inflation outlook is stronger today than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, once the current crisis has abated, ensuring that monetary policy accompanies the recovery with a light touch may be consistent with a further adjustment in our net asset purchases. Beyond that, additional modifications to our stance should be considered carefully, for three main reasons.  First, in recent months euro area real yields have already risen more than in the United States, in spite of the different positions in the cycle (Chart 15, right panel). It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2% in a world of tighter financing conditions. This is especially important given that the equilibrium real interest rate is subject to large uncertainty (Chart 16), making it difficult to judge how far away we are from a neutral policy stance. Second, we need to be certain that removing accommodation too suddenly will not trigger market turmoil, as this could lead to financial markets overreacting and financing conditions tightening abruptly. This would set back the recovery in underlying inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at our target. We have already seen that, in the current environment, inflation expectations are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in the expected path of policy. Before the escalation of tensions in Ukraine, markets had brought forward their expectations of rate lift-off. This was associated with a reversal in the improvement of market-based inflation expectations (Chart 17, left panel).[14]  The fact that this decrease in inflation expectations was unique to the euro area[15] might have revealed concerns that the ECB would overreact to current inflation numbers and adjust its monetary policy too much and too quickly. These concerns were also hinted at by the shape of the €STR forward curve, which peaked in 2024 and then inverted somewhat, reflecting investors’ perceptions that the economy would be unable to sustain interest rates at those levels (Chart 17, right panel).  The end of net asset purchases in the euro area in 2018 was smooth mainly because short-term rates remained anchored by our forward guidance. We have not been in a situation before where markets are simultaneously reappraising the path of asset purchases and the path of rates, which could increase term premia along the yield curve. Moreover, markets are reappraising the tightening intentions of all major central banks at the same time, increasing the risk of undesirable spillovers on euro area financing conditions. Third, a key lesson from the previous crisis is not only that rates should not be raised prematurely, but also that doing so without the right framework in place can lead to renewed financial fragmentation. And this fragmentation could force monetary policy into a trade-off: we would face a choice between triggering an excessive tightening of financing conditions in some parts of the euro area, which would result in domestic demand that is too low, or adjusting the stance by less than would be optimal.  Today, fragmentation could result from the legacy effects of the pandemic, so we need a different mechanism for addressing it than during the financial crisis.[16] We have a framework that has served us well over the last two years, when the flexibility of our pandemic emergency purchase programme and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU instrument proved sufficient to stem fragmentation. This gives us a good indication of the direction we should now take. And we know from experience that the more credible a backstop is, the less likely it is to be used.

Faced with high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook with pitfalls on both sides, we should adjust policy carefully and recalibrate it as we see the effects of our decisions, so as to avoid suffocating the recovery and cement progress towards price stability.  That was already the case before the invasion of Ukraine, but this terrible event has made the need for prudence even greater. The world has become darker, and our steps should be smaller still.  At the ECB we stand by the people of Ukraine, who are now seeing what they hold dearest threatened by an unjustifiable act of aggression that violates the most fundamental principles of international law. That a country can be subjected to a full military invasion should steel our determination to defend those principles wherever we are, however we can.  The ECB’s role is clear: we will take any measures necessary, using all our instruments to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets. This is the duty of a central bank in times of emergency. And we will swiftly implement the sanctions decided on by the European Union. The scenes we have witnessed this past week will scar our memories forever. But I hope that, one day, we will look back on this moment and be proud that we did our duty, showed resolve and unity, and sought to uphold the universal values of peace, freedom and prosperity.    Brainard, W.C. (1967), “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 57, No 2, pp. 411-425. Around 60% of items in the inflation basket are currently above 2%, and the share of items that have seen price increases over the last three months is at a record high. Panetta, F. (2021a), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. The effect of higher energy prices is similar to that of a terms of trade tax that the euro area is paying to the rest of the world. See Panetta, F. (2021a), op. cit. Pre-crisis trends do not always represent the right benchmark for the recovery. The great financial crisis, for example, was created by excessive borrowing from the future which then had to be reabsorbed through a prolonged process of deleveraging. But the pandemic was a temporary exogenous shock which should not have significantly reduced the supply capacity of the economy. The pre-crisis growth path is therefore a reasonable standard. Panetta, F. (2021b), “Monetary autonomy in a globalised world”, welcome address at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world”, 26 April. For instance, Russia and Belarus produce large quantities of potash, Ukraine produces rare gases needed to produce lasers used in semi-conductor production, and Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of wheat. The ECB’s survey of large corporates paints a similar picture, foreseeing average wage increases to rise from around 2% in the recent past to 3% or more this year, although with significantly higher rates of wage growth in some sectors with labour shortages. See Gareis, J., Morris, R. and Roma, M. (2022), “Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies”, Economic Bulletin Issue 1, ECB. The average rate of negotiated wages growth was 1.5% in 2021 after 1.8% in 2020 as a whole, below our December projections. Consumers’ expectations, which arguably feed most directly into wage negotiations, show a distinct but temporary “hump” shape compared with January last year (the distribution in January 2022 shifts out for 1-year ahead expectations but shifts back in for 3-year ahead expectations, see Chart 13). Longer-term expectations are also becoming more concentrated around the 2% level compared with a year ago (Chart 14, left panel), while a growing number of monetary analysts see inflation stabilising at 2%, with only a small proportion seeing inflation above this target (Chart 14, right panel). Despite the surge in short-term inflation, recent research analysing the option-implied probabilities of tail events indicates that investors still fear the euro area may fall back into a deflationary trap in the future, whereas for the United States the opposite risk is higher. See Hilscher, J. Raviv Bar-Ilan, A. and Reis, R., (2022), How likely is an inflation disaster?, mimeo, London School of Economics, February. The paper also shows that in 2021 market perceptions of a high-inflation outcome rose significantly for the United States, but not for the euro area. These results (which estimate the tail probabilities for persistently very high or very low inflation using the prices of inflation options) reflect, among other things the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy regime. Brainard, W.C. (1967), —op. cit. In September 2020, for example, I made the argument that “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.” See Panetta, F. (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September. Söderström, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with Uncertain Parameters,” The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No 1, pp. 125-145. This fall is also visible in measures adjusted for risk premia at shorter horizons. In the United States and the United Kingdom measures of inflation expectations have remained broadly unchanged in recent weeks. In the past, the issue was resolved with an instrument – the Outright Monetary Transactions – designed for a situation where the main driver of fragmentation was unsound national policies, for which macroeconomic adjustment programmes were designed. |\n",

This is a sad day for Europe and the world. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. In such times of extreme uncertainty, central banks need to be a source of confidence and a reliable anchor for the economy. Therefore, we are monitoring the situation closely. My remarks today reflect the macroeconomic situation predating the war. In the euro area, inflation has proven more persistent and more broad-based than expected, labour market slack is being reabsorbed at a faster pace than anticipated and pipeline pressures continue to build up. At the same time, prospects are rising that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may herald a turning point in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this environment, monetary policy needs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices today will not jeopardise price stability over the medium term. Households and firms count on the ECB to protect their purchasing power without putting at risk the current strong recovery from the crisis. Our policy framework enables us to deliver on these expectations. Our forward guidance has explicitly defined the conditions that need to be met for policy rates to be raised. And the clear sequence with which we intend to remove monetary stimulus, if and when necessary, reduces the uncertainty about how our actions will affect financing conditions and the broader economy. In the following, I will first discuss the current outlook for inflation. I will then explain the sequencing of policy measures that we will take once the Governing Council judges that policy should be normalised and will elaborate in more detail on three aspects that are more specific to the euro area. The first regards the question as to how the inflation outlook affects the policy normalisation process. The second point relates to how the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area affects the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. And the third point provides thoughts on how our sequence may interact with conditions in sovereign bond markets and the risks of fragmentation. A qualitative and quantitative change in the euro area’s inflation outlook A year ago, there was a widely shared expectation that inflation would rise sharply in response to the reopening of our economies but would subside swiftly as the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic would fade. There was a strong conviction that the combination of statistical base effects, slowing energy price inflation and the removal of one-off tax effects would mark a turning point in the euro area’s inflation trajectory towards the end of last year. These expectations have been disappointed. Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) continued to increase both in December 2021 and in January 2022, when it reached a new historical high of 5.1% (Slide 2). In January, euro area inflation surprised to the upside for the seventh consecutive month. Today, inflation is not only higher than expected, but price pressures are also visibly broadening. Measures of underlying inflation are following an unprecedented upward trend (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The prices of around two-thirds of the goods and services included in the HICP are currently increasing at an annual rate above 2% (Slide 3, right-hand chart). Less than a year ago, this share was close to 20%. Current measured inflation would be even higher if the costs of owner-occupied housing were included. Residential real estate prices continued to increase at an alarming pace. In the third quarter of 2021, prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 9% year-on-year, an unprecedented rate of increase (Slide 4, left-hand chart). If owner-occupied housing were included in the HICP, headline inflation in the third quarter of 2021 would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. For core inflation, the difference would have been twice as much – that is, core inflation would have been 2% rather than 1.4%, which is the largest difference observed since the start of the sample in 2012 (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Looking forward, the broad-based nature of recent upward surprises, extending well beyond the energy component, implies that significant uncertainty remains as to when the inflation peak will eventually be reached. What is becoming increasingly clear is that inflation is unlikely to fall back below our 2% target this year. It may increase even further over the near term before declining gradually over the course of 2022 as energy price inflation should slow. But the decline is not going to be nearly as fast as we previously anticipated. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2% target from above, rather than from below. The start of the year has seen three broad developments that corroborate this view. From pandemic to endemic? First, there are growing signs that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may bring forward the transition towards an endemic equilibrium. Although hospitalisations are still increasing in some countries alongside elevated case counts, admissions to intensive care units and fatality rates are now only a fraction of what they were in previous waves. There is a real chance that the Omicron variant could herald an inflection point after which the global community will be able to live with COVID-19 in spite of possible recurrent episodes of high case numbers. As governments worldwide are easing contact restrictions, the remaining slack in the economy will likely be reabsorbed at a faster pace than previously anticipated, in particular in contact-intensive services where the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on business and sentiment.  The most recent survey data corroborate this view for the euro area. In February, sentiment in the services sector improved sharply, back to levels seen before the discovery of the Omicron variant. A faster and more frontloaded recovery, in turn, risks increasing pressure on wages at a time when the labour market in the euro area is already showing first signs of strain. This brings me to the second point – the recovery in the labour market.  Strong recovery in the labour market Although the pandemic is still raging through the economy, slack in the labour market has continued to decline at a notably faster pace than projected (Slide 5, left-hand chart). A year ago, our central forecast was that the euro area unemployment rate would decline, on average, to 8.1% in 2022. In December 2021, the unemployment rate stood already at 7%. We are currently witnessing the strongest labour market in the history of the single currency. The unemployment rate is at a record low and below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), while the participation rate is at a record high (Slide 5, right-hand chart). Broader labour market slack, too, for which data are lagging, was already reabsorbed, by and large, by the end of the summer of last year, as strong demand is bringing more and more people – also those at the fringes of the labour market – back into work.[1]  While total hours worked still remained below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, there are good reasons to believe that the widespread easing of contact restrictions will help accelerate progress on that front too. Survey evidence confirms the picture of a tightening labour market. A rapidly rising share of firms across all economic sectors report shortages of labour as a factor limiting production. This is now the case for about a quarter to a third of all firms, a level never before observed in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand chart). Vacancy rates across the euro area are significantly higher than before the pandemic, which is consistent with firms reporting continued strong employment demand ahead (Slide 6, right-hand chart). These developments will add to pressure on wages as our economies continue to reopen. Although negotiated wage growth remains moderate, our latest corporate telephone survey among larger firms showed that wage pressures are expected to build up fast. Euro area firms anticipate considerably higher wage increases in the near term. For 2022, their average expected wage increase is 3.5%. The survey also showed that higher input costs, such as wages, are being passed through to consumer prices at a faster pace and to a larger extent than in the past, as strong pent-up demand creates a favourable environment for protecting or boosting profit margins. A faster pass-through, in turn, implies that for medium-term price pressures it is less relevant how fast wages expand today than how fast they will grow this year and next. Pipeline pressures remain elevated Third, pipeline pressures, which affect consumer price inflation with a lag, continue to build up. Import price inflation for intermediate and final consumer goods has increased further and remains at extraordinarily high levels (Slide 7, left-hand chart). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation reached a new all-time high in November. The inflation rate of services producer prices, which are an important element in the cost structure of both manufacturing and services firms, stands at 4.3%, which is almost nine times as high as its historical average. All services sectors report stronger price pressures than before the pandemic. These pipeline pressures will fade only gradually and will likely remain a source of upward pressure for consumer prices over the foreseeable future, with most firms expecting unusual cost pressures to persist for at least another six months. In addition, in large parts of the euro area the recent surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices will only be passed through to consumer prices with a lag. There is also a lot of uncertainty whether energy inflation will decline to the extent suggested by the futures curves underlying our December projections (Slide 7, right-hand chart). Brent oil spot prices are now at their highest levels since 2014 and current futures curves are well above the levels seen at the end of last year. Gas futures prices, too, are markedly higher than in December of last year. While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.[2]  In the EU, price developments under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) signal such an impending structural shift. ETS prices have recently reached a new record high of around €90 per tonne of carbon, almost three times as high as at the beginning of 2021, and they are expected to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. It is a reminder of the challenges we are facing in anticipating potential structural shifts in the underlying inflation process that could extend well beyond the energy sector.[3]  Sequencing of policy normalisation in the euro area All in all, there have been few instances in the recent past where the information set available to policymakers has changed so profoundly and in such a short period of time as has been the case since the beginning of the year. How today’s attack on Ukraine changes the euro area outlook is highly uncertain at this stage. We are monitoring the situation closely and will carefully evaluate the consequences for our policies. Based on the macroeconomic situation predating the war, however, inflationary pressures will likely prove stronger and more persistent over both the near and the medium term. Policy optionality is therefore needed more than ever to protect price stability.[4]  Our decisions in December of last year to end net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and to recalibrate the path of future purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) have been a first important step in this direction. At our next meeting in March, we will reassess whether the current path of asset purchases remains consistent with the updated inflation outlook, and we will thoroughly evaluate the progress made towards meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. While both the calibration and the time of adjustment of our policy instruments are data-dependent, the sequence with which we intend to adjust our policy stance is not. Our sequencing is subject to three guideposts. The first is our rate forward guidance, which provides the anchor for the normalisation process. It defines three conditions that need to be satisfied in the view of the Governing Council for our key policy rates to be raised: first, inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon; second, inflation remaining around 2% durably for the rest of the projection horizon; and, third, realised progress in underlying inflation being consistent with our inflation target. The second guidepost is that we will stop net asset purchases under the APP “shortly before” we increase our main policy rates. “Shortly before” is a term that is deliberately vague. It does not indicate a pre-defined distance between the end of our net asset purchases and policy rate lift-off. It does, however, imply that we will end net asset purchases under the APP once we judge that it is sufficiently likely that the rate forward guidance criteria are going to be fulfilled over the foreseeable future, while rates are going to be raised only when these conditions are actually met. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key policy rates. Again, the notion of an “extended period” is kept open to leave sufficient optionality in order to be able to respond to changes in the inflation outlook. In principle, this sequence is not very different from the one adapted by many other central banks, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. It defines a clear succession of steps that leaves sufficient flexibility to adjust the length of time needed before activating the next step of the sequence. That said, there are three considerations that are more specific to the euro area. Adjusting policy when inflation is converging to target The first relates to the inflation outlook. A central bank that faces a significant risk of inflation being markedly above target over the medium term would need to initiate a rapid sequence of policy rate hikes to above their estimated neutral levels. According to survey and market-based proxies, this would require bringing policy rates well into positive territory (Slide 8). However, these are not the conditions that we are facing today.  Rather, the economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2% target over the medium term. The current inflation outlook therefore calls for a gradual normalisation of our policy stance, reflecting the significant progress made towards meeting our inflation target in the future. During such a process of gradual normalisation, the focus should be first on unwinding step-by-step the exceptional measures we took to fight low inflation, starting with net asset purchases. The degree to which policy will need to be adjusted over time depends on how the inflation outlook continues to evolve. The focus on ending net asset purchases first reflects, at least in part, the fact that their side effects tend to increase over time.[5]  The experience of the past few years demonstrates, for example, that balance sheet policies have a significantly larger impact on house prices than changes in short-term policy rates, thereby contributing to the measurable rise in residential real estate prices (Slide 9).[6]  Similarly, years of balance sheet expansion have caused the bond free float in some economies to decline to very low levels (Slide 10, left-hand chart). As such, an end to net asset purchases enhances the availability of safe assets that the market requires to function well (Slide 10, right-hand chart).[7]  Ending net asset purchases when inflation is robustly converging to our target also credibly underlines that our actions are solely guided by our mandate, refuting concerns about fiscal dominance. Finally, in the current environment of large imported inflation, reversing the current exceptional measures has the potential to mitigate inflationary pressures even without the usual long lag in policy transmission. Over the past years, these measures have contributed to large capital outflows from the euro area, thereby putting downward pressure on the euro exchange rate (Slide 11). The exit from these measures can thus support the currency and, for a net importer of energy, provide tangible and immediate support to euro area households and firms by improving the terms of trade. Choice of policy instruments The second aspect relates to the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. This choice crucially depends on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The euro area remains a bank-based economy. Although market-based debt financing has gained importance since the global financial crisis, bank credit remains by far the dominant source of external finance for euro area firms (Slide 12, left-hand chart).[8]  The financing structure, in turn, has important implications for how strongly a given monetary impulse is transmitted to the real economy. Recent ECB staff analysis finds that when the share of bank loans in total external finance is high, like in the euro area, real GDP growth often shows only a weak response to changes in long-term interest rates (Slide 12, right-hand chart). In other words, our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process. Most of firms’ credit is either linked directly to short-term rates in financial markets, such as the EURIBOR, or has fixed maturities of short duration. Half of outstanding loans to euro area firms have a maturity of one year or less. Long-term rates are not only less relevant for policy transmission, central banks also have only indirect control over the part that is not related to the expected future path of short-term interest rates, i.e. the term premium.  The latter is affected by a host of factors, such as inflation uncertainty, global spillovers or demand by price-insensitive investors. The stock of bonds held by central banks is just one of these factors. Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance. This is also why our sequence foresees that policy lift-off will predate with some distance a reduction of our balance sheet. Risks of fragmentation This brings me to my third consideration – the question as to whether and how changes in sovereign bond market conditions could challenge our sequencing. Despite significant progress in recent years, the euro area’s institutional architecture remains incomplete. In the absence of a common fiscal capacity, and with public debt at elevated levels owing to the pandemic, parts of the euro area remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. There are three mitigating factors at present, however. One is that the combination of a long period of historically low rates and the marked increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt has measurably reduced the sensitivity of debt to changes in market interest rates. The average interest rate will remain low for some time even if the marginal interest rate starts rising (Slide 13, left-hand chart). Second, with average interest rates remaining low, and inflation receding only gradually, the strong expected recovery over the coming years should lead to a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios (Slide 13, right-hand chart). Structural reforms and large-scale investments related to Next Generation EU should foster confidence in the capacity of euro area countries to generate sustained high growth. Third, our decision in December last year to reinvest flexibly under the PEPP provides a strong mechanism to preserve the transmission of monetary policy in the event of severe and self-fulfilling market dislocations that would jeopardise the achievement of our mandate. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter renewed negative shocks related to the pandemic. Hence, we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation, while our monetary policy stance is guided by our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Conclusion Let me conclude. The inflation outlook has firmed since the start of the year. Inflationary pressures have broadened and have become more persistent. The expected easing of contact restrictions, together with the strong recovery in the labour market and elevated pipeline pressures have increased upside risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, the shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook. In this environment, we need to carefully reflect on how much monetary policy stimulus is required for inflation to stabilise at our target over the medium term, so as to neither fall below 2% once the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic fade, nor to allow an extended period of high inflation to become entrenched over time. This uncertainty speaks in favour of a gradual and data-dependent normalisation that respects the sequence that we have communicated, with a view to reducing uncertainty about our actions and intentions.

Recent ECB research has shown that asset purchases have a stronger effect on house prices than changes in short-term interest rates. See also Schnabel, I.

It is more than 30 years now since the first Anti-money Laundering Directive was published in June 1991. Since then, the framework has undergone many improvements, with the previous – fifth – AML Directive being published in May 2018.  The framework grew both in terms of the number and the forms of the regulatory instruments involved, incorporating both regulations and directives, as well as regulatory technical standards and guidelines developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Market Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. Nevertheless, the AML Directive has remained the core of the legal framework.  The ECB provided opinions on many of those legislative proposals. The ECB does not and cannot have any mandate to exercise anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. However, as my ECB Supervisory Board colleague Edouard Fernandez-Bollo aptly articulated in a recently published blog post: “Some things matter to you, even if you are not directly responsible for them.”  The EU AML/CFT framework affects the ECB’s tasks relating to the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the tasks that fall within its central banking mandate.  In particular, it is important for the ECB to factor the outcomes of AML/CFT supervision into its prudential supervisory processes. The risk of the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing is relevant for ECB prudential supervisory decisions on acquisitions of qualifying holdings in supervised entities, granting and withdrawing authorisations to credit institutions, and suitability assessments of existing or prospective managers of supervised entities. The outcomes of AML/CFT supervision are also reflected in day-to-day supervision as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.  Since the exchange of confidential information between the ECB and the AML/CFT supervisors was enabled in 2018 by an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, the ECB, as a prudential supervisor, has concluded an agreement on information exchange with more than 50 AML/CFT supervisory authorities across all Members States of the European Economic Area. This cooperation was further enhanced by subsequent amendments to the Directive in 2019, as well as by the establishment of AML/CFT colleges, in which the ECB participates as an observer. Over the past years the ECB has also been actively contributing to the work of the EBA’s AML Standing Committee. Good and efficient cooperation with AML/CFT supervisory authorities is therefore an important priority for us. Last year, following discussions in the Council of the EU, the Commission presented a set of legislative proposals for major changes to the EU AML/CFT framework: The first substantial change consists in transforming most of the requirements addressed to private entities from the AML Directive to a directly applicable EU regulation.  The second, and even more fundamental change is the establishment of a new authority at the EU level with a mandate for both direct and indirect AML/CFT supervision across all EU Member States. We see this as an important shift which has the potential to bring a more harmonised application of EU AML/CFT requirements and convergence of practices in AML/CFT supervision across the EU.  The third and most prominent change, which concerns the ECB’s central banking activities, is the introduction of an EU-wide limit to payments in cash. This type of measure has so far only been implemented at the level of individual Member States by means of national legislation. In the past the ECB has opined on a number of such national legislative measures. The legislative package published by the Commission consists of four legislative acts. The ECB was consulted on most elements of the legislative package by the European Parliament and the Council in October 2021. The ECB Governing Council recently adopted and published its opinions on all four elements of the package. My colleagues will give more details on the main themes which the ECB opinions touch upon. Most of the observations and suggestions in the ECB opinions seek to improve the framework of cooperation and information exchange with the future AML Authority, as well as the national AML/CFT authorities.  The ECB incorporated in its opinions its experience from establishing EU-level prudential supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, to the extent that it could be useful in establishing the EU-level AML/CFT supervision. I would like to highlight that the criteria for identifying the selected entities that will be under the direct supervision of the future AML Authority are relatively strict. The Commission envisages that only between 12 and 20 obliged entities will meet these criteria. Based on its experience, the ECB would strongly support amending these criteria such that a wider pool of obliged entities would be directly supervised by the AML Authority, including entities headquartered in each Member State. This would promote a common supervisory culture and convergence of AML/CFT supervisory practices.  Also, considering the strict, risk-based nature of the selection criteria, the publication of the list of selected obliged entities would be tantamount to indirectly disclosing the high money laundering risk status of selected supervised entities, sending unintended signals to the markets or creating reputational issues for selected obliged entities directly supervised by the new AML authority.  The most prominent element of the ECB opinions is the analysis of the proposed limit to cash payments. While the proposed limit of €10,000 euro does not appear problematic, the ECB brings several considerations to the attention of the co-legislators with a view to protecting the legal tender status of euro banknotes, in line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU.  Let me now hand over to my colleagues who will present the ECB opinions in greater detail.

And thank you to the Chair of the panel for allowing me to open the discussion with some remarks on the importance of transition planning. I fully appreciate the irony of what I’m about to say, what with you in Paris and me here on-screen, but we are all on the path to Paris. Citizens, firms, banks and prudential supervisors alike are working towards the climate goals agreed in 2015 as the EU and national governments roll out policies implementing the Paris Agreement.  In previous speeches, I have stressed the need for banks to put in place transition plans compatible with EU policies implementing the Paris Agreement – plans with concrete intermediate milestones to enhance banks’ long-term strategies and decision-making. More and more banks are already doing this themselves, while the European Commission also called for enhanced transition planning in its sustainable finance strategy published in July 2021.  For ECB Banking Supervision, the main concern that needs to be addressed by these transition plans is the level of banks’ risk exposures and the effectiveness of their controls. Have the exposures been sufficiently mitigated and are they prudent? As climate-related and environmental risks become increasingly widespread and more material, banks will, inevitably, be exposed to them, through both physical and transition risks. Banks therefore need adequate risk mitigation measures in place. This is what we need to assess as the prudential supervisor.  Introducing a legal requirement for banks to have a clear, detailed and prudent transition plan in place would increase the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory framework and contribute to maintaining a level playing field. Needless to say, we are very happy to see that this is exactly what the European Commission has proposed in its review of the Capital Requirements Directive, which is now with the co-legislators.  But it doesn’t stop there. For banks to be able to manage their transition risks adequately, they need to have information on how their customers are performing relative to a Paris-aligned transition path. This is where the European Commission’s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive comes in. The ECB welcomed this proposed directive in a legal opinion and it is now awaiting approval by the co-legislators.  The current standards on sustainability disclosure are insufficient to ensure that sustainability-related financial risks are properly understood and priced by market participants. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is a necessary step to address the gaps that currently hinder the development of appropriate sustainability policy, risk assessment and risk monitoring frameworks for the financial sector. This is because it will not only explicitly ask large banks to disclose their transition plans, it will also ask banks’ corporate clients to do the same. This last point is crucial, as it will enable banks to assess the climate-related and environmental risks in their asset portfolios. These disclosures are therefore an important element in ensuring that banks manage all material risks, in line with what we as the prudential supervisor expect them to do.  The climate-and-environmental puzzle is still highly complicated, but we can now see the pieces slotting into place. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the elements included in the Commission’s proposals are implemented in actual binding legislation entering into force without undue delay. This will smooth the path to Paris for all.

Throughout history, money and payments have been constantly evolving. And this also holds true in the digital age. As we increasingly pay digitally and shop online, we rely less on cash. Our wallets are gradually moving from our pockets to smartphones and other electronic devices.  These changes have profound implications for the nature of money itself, raising the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies for retail use.  Today I will argue that in a digital world CBDCs are necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilising force at the heart of the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty.  But CBDCs will need to be carefully designed. To be successful, they will need to add value for users, support competition rather than crowd out private innovation, and avoid risks to financial intermediation.  Why we need central bank digital money Our monetary system is based on the complementarity of private money with public money – which is available for retail payments in the form of banknotes.[1]  Confidence in private means of payment is determined by our ability to convert private money into safe public money. This is because central bank money is a risk-free form of money that is guaranteed by the State: by its strength, its credibility, its authority.  Other types of money are liabilities of private issuers: their value is based on the soundness of the issuer and is underpinned by the promise of one-to-one convertibility with central bank money.[2] Our readiness to hold private money such as bank deposits reflects the confidence that we can always go to a branch or a cash machine and convert our deposits into cash. The fact that we can do this tells us that our deposits are safe. It reassures us that we will be able to convert them into risk-free central bank money in the future, too.  Bank runs and financial crises start when confidence in the convertibility of private money evaporates.[3] Without the anchor of sovereign money, people would constantly have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money. This would undermine confidence in the singleness of money and impair the functioning of the payments system.[4]  History provides examples for this. In times when various forms of private money coexisted in the absence of sovereign money – such as the free banking era of the 19th century – the notes issued by banks often traded at variable prices[5] and instability risks[6] required dominant banks and clearinghouses to act as quasi-central banks[7]. The consensus among central banks on the coexistence between public and private money was summarised 20 years ago as follows: “The composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency. In other words, central banks would accept neither an outcome in which central bank money crowds out private initiative, nor an outcome in which central bank money is phased out by a market mechanism.”[8]  In the digital age, however, banknotes could lose their role as a reference value in payments, undermining the integrity of the monetary system.[9] Central banks must therefore consider how to ensure that their money can remain a payments anchor in a digital world.  Some have suggested that innovative private payment solutions such as stablecoins could, if properly regulated, make CBDCs superfluous.[10] However, confidence in stablecoins would also depend on the ability to convert them into central bank money,[11] unless stablecoin issuers were allowed to invest the reserve assets in risk-free deposits at the central bank. But this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money, which would endanger monetary sovereignty.[12] Moreover, in the absence of public money, stablecoins could exacerbate the “winner-takes-all” dynamics inherent in payment markets, with adverse consequences for the functioning of the payments system.[13] And stablecoins’ potentially large investments in safe assets could affect the availability of these assets.[14] This could in turn have an impact on market functioning and real interest rates, with undesirable implications from a monetary policy perspective.[15]  Other threats to monetary sovereignty could emerge in the absence of a domestic digital currency. If a foreign CBDC were to be widely adopted, this could lead to digital currency substitution[16]. This risk would be higher for small countries with unstable currencies and weak fundamentals, especially if the CBDC were issued in a major economy.[17] But it could eventually also affect leading currencies.[18]  Such risks are not imminent, but they should not be underestimated. Just as the US dollar overtook the pound sterling as the leading reserve currency within only a decade of the end of the First World War,[19] digital innovation may give rise to powerful new foreign contenders, with disruptive consequences for those markets that are not prepared to face the digital challenge.  The widespread adoption of a foreign CBDC would increase the risk of financial transactions being based on technologies managed and supervised elsewhere, with limited oversight by domestic authorities. A system of this kind may not have sufficient safeguards against external threats, including cyber threats. It could put the confidential data of people, businesses, and states at greater risk of being misused. And it could make the information needed to counter criminal activities harder to trace.  The scenario I am describing is not one of science fiction. It is already the case in the market for crypto-assets, which are widely used for criminal activities.[20] A similar situation might affect other digital asset markets in the future. So the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted, and this will make a big difference.[21] But it may not be sufficient.  The main benefits of CBDCs  A CBDC would preserve the coexistence of sovereign and private money in a digital world. This is not an abstract benefit – it is the basis for financial and monetary stability, ensuring competition and efficiency in payment markets. But a CBDC could generate even more benefits for users.  It could improve the confidentiality of digital payments. The information contained in electronic transactions can be monetised by private companies[22], posing a threat to privacy. This risk is further compounded by big techs starting to offer financial services and by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Data protection regulation aims to prevent misuse, but cannot always keep pace with technological innovation, as we have seen in past cases of data breaches and misuse by tech companies.[23]  If a digital currency were offered by an independent public institution such as the central bank – which has no interest in exploiting individual payment data for any purpose – it could enhance, not reduce, the confidentiality of electronic payments. Potential users clearly want this: when we consulted the public on the topic, privacy was identified as the most important aspect of a digital euro.[24] Sound governance arrangements that comply with data protection regulations would ensure that payment information is only accessed for permitted purposes, such as countering illegal activities. We are cooperating with the relevant European authorities on this issue.  A digital euro would also increase choice and reduce costs, contributing to a level playing field in payments.[25] Key segments of the euro area payments market, such as cards and e-payments, are dominated by a handful of players, which strengthens their pricing power. Some estimates suggest that Europeans pay about 1.4% of GDP for payments services. In the United States, the costs are higher.[26]  One might argue that private service providers are already well equipped to offer low-cost digital payment solutions. However, the limited evidence available suggests that low-income households use digital payments less than high-income households. This is consistent with the hypothesis that digital payments remain expensive for many users.[27] And even in advanced financial systems, many citizens are “unbanked” or “underbanked”.[28] Although financial inclusion depends on several factors, such as financial and digital literacy, the cost of financial services is likely to play a role.  Our digital euro project comes with a commitment that all – including vulnerable population groups – will have access to safe public money in the digital era.  Designing a successful digital euro  The fact that CBDCs are necessary to guarantee the smooth functioning of the payments market does not mean that their success should be taken for granted. Users may lack incentives to fully appreciate such benefit and – given the vast supply of private digital monies – could show limited interest in CBDCs. Indeed, we face two opposite risks: being “too successful” and crowding out private payment solutions and financial intermediation, or being “not successful enough” and generating insufficient demand. We take both risks seriously.  To avoid interfering with the functioning of the financial system, we are considering how to make the digital euro a convenient medium of exchange but not an attractive form of investment. We are examining the pros and cons of introducing a quantitative cap on digital euro holdings[29] or a tiered remuneration that would disincentivise excessive holdings.[30] We are analysing the potential impact on monetary policy. To ensure that our digital currency would be a convenient means of payment, we are working to make it available within private payment solutions, so that people would be able to use it easily wherever they can pay digitally. We aim to level the playing field by allowing intermediaries – including small ones – to offer innovative solutions to their customers. And we are considering how a digital euro could improve financial inclusion. We are interviewing focus groups to identify the characteristics of a digital euro that would add value for users. And we are working on the technical options to reconcile different objectives such as the right of individuals to confidentiality versus the public interest in guaranteeing the transparency required to counter illegal activities; or the benefits of allowing the digital euro to be widely used versus the need to safeguard financial intermediation.  We have launched several work streams: on the design choices that can guarantee confidentiality, on the prioritisation of different use cases,[31] and on the business options for intermediaries[32]. We will cover areas such as cyber security and operational resilience.  We are interacting with all relevant stakeholders, from intermediaries to consumers, merchants and authorities. We are cooperating with the European Parliament, the European Commission and the finance ministers of the euro area countries. To get technical advice and collect a broad range of views on possible solutions, we have set up a Market Advisory Group[33] and are regularly discussing the project with the Euro Retail Payments Board[34], academics and think tanks. Bearing in mind the international implications of CBDCs,[35] we are cooperating with other major central banks. In October 2021 we launched a two-year investigation phase to define the design features of the digital currency. At the end of 2023 we could decide to start a realisation phase to develop and test the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro, which could take three years. Only thereafter will we decide whether to actually issue a digital euro.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  For decades, the complementarity of public money and private money has guaranteed stability, competition and innovation.  The digitalisation of payments cannot be ignored by central banks, which have so far provided their money only in physical form. Central banks cannot escape these transformations, nor should they underestimate the potential for far-reaching shifts that may occur.  To ensure that public money maintains its fundamental role in the digital age, the ECB has launched an investigation into the possible issuance of a digital euro alongside cash.  The digital euro is an ambitious and complex project that can improve the efficiency of the economic and financial system. We want to make it a driver of stability and inclusive progress, capable of strengthening ties between economies and financial systems around the world. Our experience may provide useful insights for other central banks. And likewise, we are keen to learn from them. I am therefore pleased to exchange views with US experts, and I am now looking forward to our discussion.    Although central bank money can also take the form of reserves (deposits that commercial banks hold at the central bank), the focus of this speech will be on cash. One-to-one convertibility with central bank money is what makes the regulated forms of money convertible with each other and is why they are perceived as interchangeable when making payments. This does not mean that the safeguards put in place to protect savings – legislation and banking supervision, deposit insurance schemes, capital markets supervision – are not important. On the contrary. They must, however, be flanked by convertibility to ensure the smooth functioning of payments and the stability of the financial system. On the singleness of money see Bank for International Settlements (2003),  The role of central bank money in payment systems , Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, August. For instance, the notes of new banks were more heavily discounted. See Gorton, G. (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No 2, pp. 346-397. Price variability was inconvenient, as users had to consult a note reporter to monitor the value of the notes in circulation. See Eichengreen, B. (2019), “From Commodity to Fiat and Now to Crypto: What Does History Tell Us?”, NBER Working Paper Series, No 25426, January. The experience of the free banking era in the United States varied considerably among states and each had a significant number of problem banks. See Rolnick, A.J. and Weber, W.E. (1983), “New Evidence on the Free Banking Era”, American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No 5, pp. 1080-1091. In the United States, dominant banks disciplined note issuing banks by threatening them with bulk redemption of their notes, while clearinghouses regulated member bank levels of equity, reserves, and interest rates, audited members, produced money during crises and issued a form of insurance; See Gorton, G. (1985), “Banking theory and free banking history: A Review Essay”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 16(2), 267-276. See Bank for International Settlements (2003), op. cit. For an overview of the role of central bank money over the past 20 years, see Bindseil, U., and Terol, I (2020), “The evolving role of central bank money in payments”, Central Banking, 15 July. While banks could continue to hold central bank money in the form of reserves, this may not prove sufficient to fully preserve the monetary anchor role of central bank money. People would be unable to use central bank money as means of exchange and would thus have little incentive to hold it. This would weaken the unit of account role of sovereign money. If the currency is not demanded by the public, the mere announcement that the central bank would make it available would not be enough to preserve its role in the economy. In history, sovereign money was at times used as unit of account but not as a medium of exchange. This was for example the case of the livre, the “imaginary money” introduced by Charlemagne in the monetary reform of the eighth century, named after the libra (pound), the sovereign money introduced by the ancient King of Rome Servius Tullius in the sixth century BC. The livre was never coined and never circulated. However, it had a fixed conversion rate with another form of sovereign money, the denier (1 livre was equal to 240 deniers), which was actually coined and actively used as means of exchange.

The value of a stablecoin is linked to a portfolio of one or more other assets (the reserve assets), including currency in the form of commercial bank deposits. Stablecoins can therefore be low-risk but not risk-free. Risks increase if stablecoin arrangements are backed by risky or opaque assets, especially in times of market turmoil.

New players, including operating platforms with huge customer bases, can exploit network effects and economies of scale to build dominant positions, creating their own closed-loop ecosystems. They may exploit customer data for private scoring and other uses. They may erect barriers to impede interoperability and use their “coins” to displace other forms of money.

While the international role of a currency will continue to depend to a large extent on the fundamentals of the underlying economy, availability in CBDC form would facilitate use in cross-border payments by reducing frictions and costs. Model simulations suggest that the share of a country’s currency in global export payments increases when it is available as a CBDC, but continues to depend to a large extent on forces such as the size and the stability of the economy and the development and efficiency of the financial sector.

The European Union is revising the regulation, supervision and oversight of digital finance with the proposed Regulation of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and the ECB’s new payment oversight framework (PISA). The discussion on regulatory steps is also ongoing in other advanced economies, e.g. in the United States.

Beyond the well-known case of Oxford Analytica, big tech firms are facing increased criticism over revelations that staff and contractors listened to audio recordings of people speaking to virtual assistants, and voice chats recorded on messenger apps. Even children were affected: one major video-sharing app popular among young people was heavily fined in 2019 by the US Federal Trade Commission for collecting personal data from children under 13.

In the public consultation conducted by the ECB in 2020, 43% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of a digital euro, well ahead of other features. The other characteristics highlighted in the consultation were the security of payments and usability throughout the euro area, which were ranked first by 18% and 11% of those surveyed, respectively.

See McKinsey (2020),  The 2020 McKinsey Global Payments Report.  Based on the Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE), the preference for cash in the euro area is significantly higher among low-income respondents. While only 36% of those with an income of €1,000 per month or less have a preference for cards or other cashless means of payment, that preference was expressed by 61% in the income bracket of €2,500 and more. See Panetta, F. (2021), “Cash still king in times of COVID-19”, speech at the Deutsche Bundesbank’s 5th International Cash Conference on “Cash in times of turmoil”, 15 June. Although they are often invisible to the customer, the various layers of merchant fees can add up to some 3% of the transaction value. According to Glory Global Solutions, “Some banks tell merchants to budget for between 2.5% and 3% of the transaction valuable, but with so many variables, this is only ever a rough guide.” See Glory Global Solutions (2018),  Electronic Payments – Not As Cheap As You Think . In the United States, 6% of adults do not have a checking, savings, or money market account. See Federal Reserve (2019),  Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2018 - May 2019 . In the euro area there are still more than 5% of adults without a payment account. See World Bank (2017),  Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database  .  In the case of quantitative holding limits, we are considering waterfall solutions linking digital euro accounts to private money accounts, to allow payments in excess of the limit. Bindseil, U.

Use cases refer to the various interactions between people, businesses, Government and machines (e.g. payments at the point of sale, online, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, etc.). Business options are naturally related to costs (fees, devices), but can also include the front end, taking into account consumers’ preference to use the current payment methods, be it their smartphone, card or cash. A digital euro should provide a similar payment experience, while also considering future innovations like QR codes, which are becoming more and more popular.

Our focus today is the current state of C&amp;E risk management practices in the banking sector, and the ECB’s upcoming thematic review of these risks. Over the last couple of years, we have launched several targeted actions in this direction. In 2020 we issued the ECB guide on C&amp;E risks and in 2021 we conducted a supervisory review of banks’ approaches to managing these risks based on their own assessments. The ECB has progressively taken C&amp;E risks into greater account in its supervision, as have banks in their business.  2022 will be the year that C&amp;E risks become integrated in the day-to-day activities of our joint supervisory teams, who are in constant contact with banks. These risks will come to form an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with supervised entities and the supervisory review and evaluation process, the SREP. This will ultimately influence banks’ minimum capital requirements. The encompassing and integrated approach – which supervisors and banks are already very familiar with for traditional risk categories – is what I call the immersive supervisory approach to C&amp;E risks. Along with the 2022 ECB supervisory stress test, the thematic review forms part of the ECB Banking Supervision roadmap to ensure that banks adequately incorporate C&amp;E risk management. These supervisory activities complement the ECB’s broader C&amp;E agenda, which includes publishing the results of an economy-wide climate change stress test, and our 2021 action plan to include climate change considerations in our monetary policy. The state of C&amp;E risk management  Climate and environmental risks are impossible to avoid. The public knows it and the ECB knows it. The banks themselves now know it, as reflected in the outcome of their internal assessments. All banks that thoroughly assessed their exposure to C&amp;E risks concluded that these risks are material. By contrast, not a single materiality assessment submitted by banks that reported no material risk exposure was deemed adequate. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the banks that acknowledged the materiality of the C&amp;E risks they faced did so for both transition and physical risks. And they acknowledged that these risks are material in both the short and the long term. Despite this broad acknowledgement of the materiality of these risks, and thus the need to adequately manage them, we see that most banks still have a considerable way to go in developing their risk management capabilities. As the findings we published last year show, banks reported that 90% of their practices are only partially or not at all in line with ECB supervisory expectations. Let me repeat: 90%. This is both bad news and good news. Bad news because, at the time of their assessment, banks were a long way away from where they needed to be. But good news because half the banks we supervise already acknowledge that climate risks are an inevitable part of their day-to-day business. We therefore expect banks to analyse how C&amp;E risks can or will affect their portfolios and products over the short, medium and long term, and under various scenarios, too. This type of forward-looking analysis of C&amp;E risk should be basic practice, just as it would be for any other type of risk. Moreover, beyond merely formally attributing responsibilities, we still see banks making little progress towards more actively managing the C&amp;E risks they face. Even certain banks that recognise the materiality of C&amp;E risks have not reported any practices to either reduce or manage their level of risk. This year we want to see firm progress in how banks incorporate C&amp;E risks in their risk management. In doing so, banks should adopt a strategic approach to managing these risks, using the full array of the risk management instruments at their disposal. This includes strategically realigning portfolios, setting clear risk appetites, developing mitigation strategies, adjusting qualitative credit criteria and quantifying and holding capital. Another key area in which banks can make progress is by actively supporting their clients in mitigating and adapting to the different types of climate and environmental risks. Moreover, banks can draw on the industry’s good practices that we shared last year in our report. In the face of data challenges and methodological uncertainties, banks have an even stronger imperative to get moving. To be clear, banks should not misconstrue the ECB’s actions as an outright call for divesting from carbon-intensive activities or from geographical regions vulnerable to physical risk. Rather, we are asking banks to fully grasp the physical and transition risks and to actively start managing them, with the aim of making their portfolios more resilient to C&amp;E risks. Not all sectors will decarbonise overnight. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios show that certain sectors will continue to rely on carbon-intensive technologies for some time. We as prudential supervisors merely need banks to understand what the transition entails for their risk exposures to those sectors, and to reflect it in their overall risk management strategy. What we do not expect is an outright withdrawal from carbon-intensive industries, nor do we expect it to happen for every single sector or counterparty – but we do expect banks to harbour the capacity to manage the risks emerging from climate change. To draw a comparison with traditional risk exposures, we, as supervisors, would of course not expect banks to divest from all assets that entail credit risks, but we do insist that these risks are managed appropriately. C&amp;E risks are to be managed just like any other risk; and their sound management requires sound risk controls. This is precisely one of our focus areas in the upcoming thematic review on C&amp;E risks. Supervisory roadmap for C&amp;E risks For several years, the ECB has identified banks’ exposure to C&amp;E risks as one of the main vulnerabilities in the European banking sector. Assessing and helping banks address risks stemming from climate change and environmental degradation will be one of our supervisory priorities from now until 2024, albeit these risks have been on our minds for far longer. I remember giving my first speeches on this topic in late 2015 when still an executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank. So, we have already come a long way and our supervision of C&amp;E risks will now take more concrete form. The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&amp;E risks.  The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&amp;E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the banks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front.  The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C&amp;E risks, which is a key topic of the session today. Two years after we launched the supervisory guide on C&amp;E risks, we are conducting this thematic review to follow up on the self-assessment exercise conducted last year. Our main goal will be to assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks’ C&amp;E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C&amp;E risk strategies and risk profiles. Do all banks’ processes and analyses have visible consequences? Does the way in which banks actually steer their balance sheets and risk profiles reflect the materiality of C&amp;E risks? These will be some of the core questions of this review.  As part of this exercise, we will monitor banks’ alignment with the supervisory expectations set out in the guide, and encourage banks’ progress towards the industry’s best practices. Fortunately, those practices were identified across different European banks over the last two years. They show that some banks are already doing what we are asking. The ECB is doing its part by guiding banks in their climate journey, setting forth supervisory expectations and sharing updates on good practices in the industry. In light of the efforts banks have already made in devising their action plans, as well as all the information on this topic published to date – by both the ECB and several other public and private organisations we expect to see material progress in banks’ implementation deadlines and concrete actions.  As part of the thematic review, we will also be looking more closely at the risk management practices for environmental risks such as risks to biodiversity, water stress and pollution. All have similar features and warrant a coordinated approach. Banks can make significant savings if, taking advantage of the momentum, they extend the range of their preparations to cover all these risks, and are thus ready for a new, more concrete, supervisory and regulatory environment. Our benchmark from last year shows that, as of early 2021, very few banks were looking into environmental risks beyond climate. We have highlighted this gap to banks. This year, we will assess how banks are managing their exposures to environmental risks beyond climate and follow up accordingly.  As we build our joint supervisory teams’ capacity to help banks understand and incorporate C&amp;E risks, our supervisors will treat these risks just like any other. Last year’s review was conducted by a central team of experts, with the joint supervisory teams conducting the follow-up dialogue with the bank. By contrast, this thematic review will be fully embedded in the work of every joint supervisory team. While still backed by a central team of experts, the review will be driven from the engine room of supervision. And this is where the supervision of C&amp;E risks will stay. Following up on the thematic review, all banks under our direct supervision will receive comprehensive feedback setting out any shortcomings identified. Combined with the observations from the climate stress test, this will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. Targeted qualitative requirements may also be imposed. As part of the review, we will also carefully check whether banks have followed up on any requirements we issued last year. The thematic review is a full-on supervisory review. As such, we also have the full set of supervisory measures at our disposal to address shortcomings. Those banks that continue to fail to conduct a materiality assessment of C&amp;E risks or have not followed-up on earlier requirements will start noticing just that. Regulatory and supervisory framework  The ECB is taking action under its mandate and under the current prudential framework to get banks to where they need to be in terms of incorporating C&amp;E risks into their business. Our supervisory activities are thus keeping in line with the rapidly evolving regulatory and supervisory framework.  For example, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive proposed by the European Commission will further articulate the integration of C&amp;E risks in the legal framework and will require banks to develop transition plans and supervisors to scrutinise them. This is the next important step in risk management, which I have mentioned on previous occasions, and which will require banks to look thirty years ahead and devise intermediate targets for their risk exposures that can render their risk management practices fit for an economy that will transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.  And finally, disclosure frameworks and taxonomies are also developing rapidly to create an information architecture to enable banks to manage the risks and scale up green finance. Both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have intensive work programmes to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework can better cater for climate-related risks. One concrete example is the EBA’s recently published implementing technical standards for the disclosure of Environmental Social and Governance risks, which also require large banks to start disclosing their alignment with the IEA pathways by June 2024 at the latest for all relevant portfolios. Banks are running out of time to complete their preparations. On all these fronts, the sooner banks act, the smoother the transition will be for them, and for the economy they help support.  Conclusion  For ECB Banking Supervision, 2022 marks the third year of dedicated C&amp;E risk activities. First, we issued our guide with supervisory expectations. Next, we asked banks to share with us their self-assessments on how their practices match our expectations. And they have indeed been very open and candid in these self-assessments, for which I am truly grateful.  Together we have learnt that there is a lot of room for improvement. Considering the importance, urgency and long-lasting nature of climate change, we are asking banks to intensify their efforts in measuring and managing C&amp;E risks in line with our expectations. With the exercises that we are conducting this year, the prudential supervision of climate-related risks is moving closer to maturity. The thematic review is the next step in fully immersing C&amp;E risks in the work of the joint supervisory teams and marks key progress towards their integration in the SREP. It crystalises our commitment to ensuring that the prudential supervision of C&amp;E risks is here to stay.

       "1    SPEECH  Small steps in a dark room: guiding policy on the path out of the pandemic   Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an online seminar organised by the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies and Florence School of Banking and Finance at the European University Institute Frankfurt am Main, 28 February 2022 After many years of too-low inflation in the euro area, fears have turned to the prospect that inflation may remain too high for too long. Across advanced economies, the current inflation spike is proving to be broader and more persistent than initially expected, leading central banks to reassess the risk that it could become entrenched. This is no easy task, especially in the euro area.  Economic conditions in the euro area have benefited from the strong response of monetary policy and its positive interactions with fiscal policy during the pandemic. But this is not a typical business cycle, and we are not seeing a typical recovery.  The current inflation spike is for the most part not being driven by domestic factors – by an economy that is “running hot”, in other words. Demand remains below its pre-crisis trend.  Instead, the economy is experiencing a series of imported supply shocks that are pushing up inflation and depressing demand. The exit from the pandemic is characterised by global mismatches between demand and supply – in energy and goods markets in particular – with uneven effects across sectors.  As a result, past economic regularities may be a poor guide for the future.  This makes medium-term developments extremely hard to anticipate. There are forces at play that could delay the recovery and contain underlying price pressures, and others that could lead to accelerating inflation. Policy mistakes in either direction could push the economy onto an unfavourable path.  Faced with such uncertainty, there is a case for the central bank to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps in adjusting policy, so as not to suffocate the as yet incomplete recovery.  If we are to durably escape the low inflation and low growth environment that has defined the past decade, we cannot afford to waste the progress we have made so far. In the spirit of William Brainard[1], we should take small steps in a dark room. The dramatic conflict in Ukraine is now weighing negatively on both supply and demand conditions, making uncertainty more acute and exacerbating risks to the medium-term inflation outlook on both sides. In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer. And the ECB stands ready to act to avoid any dislocation in financial markets that could stem from the war in Ukraine and to protect the transmission of monetary policy.  Inflation as an imported phenomenon The recent inflation data in the euro area do not make for easy reading. Headline inflation reached 5% in January and is expected to stay above 2% for the entire year, while core inflation is at 2.3%. Inflation pressures are becoming widespread (Chart 1).[2]  To determine how monetary policy should respond, we need to understand the drivers of this inflation spike. I have previously spoken about “good”, “bad” and “ugly” inflation in this context, and each of these has different implications for policy.[3]  In short, good inflation is driven by domestic demand and wages consistent with our target, which monetary policy should seek to nurture until that target is reached. Bad inflation instead reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices and depress economic activity, which monetary policy should look through. Ugly inflation – the worst type of inflation – is driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which monetary policy should immediately stamp out. Data indicate that bad inflation is still dominating in the euro area today.  Unlike in the United States, our economy is not experiencing excess domestic demand. Household nominal income has not recovered its pre-pandemic trend and households are saving more of their income than they did before the pandemic (Chart 2). Consumer spending and investment both remain well below their pre-crisis trends (Chart 3). Inflation is largely imported, reflecting global shocks to supply and demand that are spilling over to our economy through import prices (Chart 4, left panel).  Around 60% of inflation in January was energy, of which the euro area is a net importer (Chart 4, right panel). This is the consequence of the recent extraordinary increases in oil and gas prices (Chart 5, left panel). These in turn mainly reflect shocks that compress energy supply, rather than stronger aggregate demand (Chart 5, right panel). The rise in the cost of energy has further accelerated after the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Inflation is also being fuelled by the global shift in consumer spending from services to manufactured goods at a time when the pandemic has disrupted production. This has translated into global supply chain bottlenecks, high durable goods prices and strong pipeline pressures. This effect, which also represents a supply shock for the euro area, is now being reabsorbed, but at a different pace in different economies (Chart 6).  These global supply-driven increases in prices – above all energy and industrial goods, but also food – explain a good part of the currently high headline inflation (Chart 7, left panel).  In contrast, services inflation – the most domestic inflation component – has so far largely come from high-contact sectors (Chart 7, right panel). These sectors are experiencing frictions created by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and some of them (such as transport services) are also sensitive to energy prices.

Uncertainty in the inflation outlook Imported supply shocks that underpin bad inflation increase the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook in two main ways.  First, energy-driven inflation acts as a “tax”[4] on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. This adds to the uncertainty around the growth outlook, making it harder to judge when the economy is likely to reach full capacity. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was seeing a bounceback after the slowdown created by the Omicron wave. But we were still some way short of returning to our pre-crisis GDP trend, across a range of possible estimates (Chart 8). In my view, GDP reaching the bottom end of this range would be the bare minimum needed to conclude that resources are fully utilised[5] – and current projections suggest that this will not happen until the middle of 2023.  The terms of trade tax from higher energy prices could further delay the return to that growth path. The heavier energy bill has already reduced household purchasing power by around 2% (Chart 9, left panel) and is negatively affecting consumer confidence (Chart 9, right panel). It is also eroding the financial buffers built up during the pandemic, especially for households with low incomes, reducing the degree to which dissaving can support consumption in the future (Chart 10). Second, prolonged imported price shocks make it harder to assess whether inflation is feeding into domestic price pressures. The fact that core inflation is increasing above 2% may initially seem to suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are accumulating. However, rising core inflation is partly due to higher energy prices, which are pushing up costs in almost all sectors (Chart 11). Similarly, industrial goods inflation may remain elevated in the near term due to higher input costs, but beyond that its dynamics are hard to predict. Inventory levels are starting to return to normal, which suggests that demand might have peaked. The memory of supply shortages might prompt firms to build precautionary stocks that initially prolong tensions but ultimately lead to excess inventories once bottlenecks ease. This would amplify the manufacturing cycle and the volatility of goods inflation.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now intensifying this uncertainty.  We face greater financial volatility in the short term. There is a risk of renewed market dislocations as investors anticipate the potential impact of sanctions and possible retaliatory actions. And these dislocations might be felt unevenly, threatening the smooth transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. But we also face greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the medium term. The higher energy prices triggered by the conflict in Ukraine point to a longer period of above-target inflation, while supply disruptions of raw materials and food could prove more persistent[6]. At the same time, these factors increase the terms of trade tax and depress economic confidence, aggravating downside risks to growth and further delaying the return to full capacity.

Chart 9 Impact of “bad” inflation on demand    Sources: Left panel: ECB and ECB staff calculations; right panel: European Commission. Notes: Changes in purchasing power due to energy price fluctuations are computed as the year-on-year percentage change in the real price of energy, weighted by the nominal energy expenditure share (see Edelstein, P. and Kilian, L. (2009), “How sensitive are consumer expenditures to retail energy prices?”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 56, No 6, pp. 766-779). A negative value indicates a loss in consumer purchasing power. The latest observations are for January 2022.

Notes: The chart refers to average aggregate effects across the income distribution, to savings cut for those households that have positive savings and rely on them to face the shock, and to dissaving for households that do not have positive savings and thus rely on alternative sources, like accumulated savings or payment deferrals, to face the shock. In 2021 the perceived average price change for utilities was 11%, and for transport services it was 9%. The actual inflation rates for energy items could suffer from an underestimation bias in cases of rising prices because domestic energy consumption is billed with a delay. The latest observations are for January 2022.

The path to price stability This uncertainty means the path to price stability is exposed to pitfalls on both sides. As imported inflation now looks set to last longer, we will need to see wages catch up sufficiently to avoid a further fall in purchasing power. If that does not happen, we might face an adverse scenario of a slower closure of the output gap and renewed disinflationary pressures once bad inflation subsides. However, we could be also confronted with an opposite, equally adverse scenario where high inflation proves to be so persistent that it destabilises inflation expectations. That could feed into wage negotiations and domestic price pressures, entrenching inflation above our target.  Whether the economy can avoid these risks and move along a stable path depends crucially on our policy response. In such a finely balanced situation, any errant policy measure could easily push the economy onto the wrong path and put at risk what we have achieved so far. If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery. But if we are too timid in the face of mounting signs that inflation is becoming a domestic process, we might inadvertently give the impression that we lack determination to secure price stability.  In both scenarios, we should not infer the medium-term inflation outlook from present inflation figures. We need to carefully assess the prospects for wage growth, productivity growth and inflation expectations. This requires us to cross-check forward-looking indicators with evidence of what we can observe in the real economy. So far, the labour market is not looking excessively tight, especially in comparison with other jurisdictions (Chart 12, left panel), and even a significant increase in wage growth would not put it much above trend productivity growth plus our inflation target (Chart 12, right panel).[7] Wage growth has remained moderate to date[8], perhaps reflecting workers’ concerns about job security, and the shock from the Ukraine conflict could prompt further caution. Different measures of inflation expectations also show no signs of de-anchoring on the upside (Charts 13 and 14).[9]  Therefore, the danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment. At the same time, I would like to see more evidence that improvements in labour markets are translating into wage growth consistent with our 2% target to be confident that the low-inflation scenario has fully disappeared. Indeed, a key conclusion of our strategy review was that, when coming out of a long period of low inflation, we should wait to see underlying inflation sufficiently advanced before adjusting policy, of which wages are a central component. And option-implied probabilities of tail events suggest that markets still see risks of eventually falling back into a too-low inflation regime.[10]  In the current situation, the task for the ECB is therefore twofold.  First, with the crisis in Ukraine raising uncertainty to unprecedented levels, our immediate priority is to protect the functioning of the financial sector and bolster confidence, in order to contain the impact of the shock on the economy and keep in place the conditions for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  Second, we should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps as the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer.

Note: Values were rounded to one decimal place prior to aggregation.    Accompanying the recovery with a light touch More than 40 years ago, William Brainard proposed the “conservatism principle”, which calls for cautious action when policymakers are faced with uncertainty.[11]  This principle does not apply to all forms of uncertainty. For example, when faced with deflationary shocks that risk rooting interest rates at the lower bound, it pays to act more decisively.[12] The same is true when inflation expectations are at risk of becoming de-anchored.[13] Both these considerations informed the ECB’s resolute response during the first phase of the pandemic.  And if measures to avoid market dislocations prove necessary in response to the war in Ukraine, we should intervene with equal determination, using all our instruments. In this respect, we reiterated in our February decisions that “within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability”. But when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policy on the economy, it is advisable to take small steps – and this is the case for the path out of the pandemic. Confronted with supply shocks that are both inflationary and contractionary, we should adjust our policy moderately and progressively as we receive feedback on the effects of our actions. We began reducing the pace of net asset purchases last year and we are on track to return to our pre-pandemic policy setting by September this year (Chart 15, left panel). Longer-term real yields have already returned to their pre-pandemic levels in the euro area (Chart 15, right panel).  The inflation outlook is stronger today than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, once the current crisis has abated, ensuring that monetary policy accompanies the recovery with a light touch may be consistent with a further adjustment in our net asset purchases. Beyond that, additional modifications to our stance should be considered carefully, for three main reasons.  First, in recent months euro area real yields have already risen more than in the United States, in spite of the different positions in the cycle (Chart 15, right panel). It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2% in a world of tighter financing conditions. This is especially important given that the equilibrium real interest rate is subject to large uncertainty (Chart 16), making it difficult to judge how far away we are from a neutral policy stance. Second, we need to be certain that removing accommodation too suddenly will not trigger market turmoil, as this could lead to financial markets overreacting and financing conditions tightening abruptly. This would set back the recovery in underlying inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at our target. We have already seen that, in the current environment, inflation expectations are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in the expected path of policy. Before the escalation of tensions in Ukraine, markets had brought forward their expectations of rate lift-off. This was associated with a reversal in the improvement of market-based inflation expectations (Chart 17, left panel).[14]  The fact that this decrease in inflation expectations was unique to the euro area[15] might have revealed concerns that the ECB would overreact to current inflation numbers and adjust its monetary policy too much and too quickly. These concerns were also hinted at by the shape of the €STR forward curve, which peaked in 2024 and then inverted somewhat, reflecting investors’ perceptions that the economy would be unable to sustain interest rates at those levels (Chart 17, right panel).  The end of net asset purchases in the euro area in 2018 was smooth mainly because short-term rates remained anchored by our forward guidance. We have not been in a situation before where markets are simultaneously reappraising the path of asset purchases and the path of rates, which could increase term premia along the yield curve. Moreover, markets are reappraising the tightening intentions of all major central banks at the same time, increasing the risk of undesirable spillovers on euro area financing conditions. Third, a key lesson from the previous crisis is not only that rates should not be raised prematurely, but also that doing so without the right framework in place can lead to renewed financial fragmentation. And this fragmentation could force monetary policy into a trade-off: we would face a choice between triggering an excessive tightening of financing conditions in some parts of the euro area, which would result in domestic demand that is too low, or adjusting the stance by less than would be optimal.  Today, fragmentation could result from the legacy effects of the pandemic, so we need a different mechanism for addressing it than during the financial crisis.[16] We have a framework that has served us well over the last two years, when the flexibility of our pandemic emergency purchase programme and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU instrument proved sufficient to stem fragmentation. This gives us a good indication of the direction we should now take. And we know from experience that the more credible a backstop is, the less likely it is to be used.

Faced with high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook with pitfalls on both sides, we should adjust policy carefully and recalibrate it as we see the effects of our decisions, so as to avoid suffocating the recovery and cement progress towards price stability.  That was already the case before the invasion of Ukraine, but this terrible event has made the need for prudence even greater. The world has become darker, and our steps should be smaller still.  At the ECB we stand by the people of Ukraine, who are now seeing what they hold dearest threatened by an unjustifiable act of aggression that violates the most fundamental principles of international law. That a country can be subjected to a full military invasion should steel our determination to defend those principles wherever we are, however we can.  The ECB’s role is clear: we will take any measures necessary, using all our instruments to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets. This is the duty of a central bank in times of emergency. And we will swiftly implement the sanctions decided on by the European Union. The scenes we have witnessed this past week will scar our memories forever. But I hope that, one day, we will look back on this moment and be proud that we did our duty, showed resolve and unity, and sought to uphold the universal values of peace, freedom and prosperity.    Brainard, W.C. (1967), “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 57, No 2, pp. 411-425. Around 60% of items in the inflation basket are currently above 2%, and the share of items that have seen price increases over the last three months is at a record high. Panetta, F. (2021a), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. The effect of higher energy prices is similar to that of a terms of trade tax that the euro area is paying to the rest of the world. See Panetta, F. (2021a), op. cit. Pre-crisis trends do not always represent the right benchmark for the recovery. The great financial crisis, for example, was created by excessive borrowing from the future which then had to be reabsorbed through a prolonged process of deleveraging. But the pandemic was a temporary exogenous shock which should not have significantly reduced the supply capacity of the economy. The pre-crisis growth path is therefore a reasonable standard. Panetta, F. (2021b), “Monetary autonomy in a globalised world”, welcome address at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world”, 26 April. For instance, Russia and Belarus produce large quantities of potash, Ukraine produces rare gases needed to produce lasers used in semi-conductor production, and Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of wheat. The ECB’s survey of large corporates paints a similar picture, foreseeing average wage increases to rise from around 2% in the recent past to 3% or more this year, although with significantly higher rates of wage growth in some sectors with labour shortages. See Gareis, J., Morris, R. and Roma, M. (2022), “Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies”, Economic Bulletin Issue 1, ECB. The average rate of negotiated wages growth was 1.5% in 2021 after 1.8% in 2020 as a whole, below our December projections. Consumers’ expectations, which arguably feed most directly into wage negotiations, show a distinct but temporary “hump” shape compared with January last year (the distribution in January 2022 shifts out for 1-year ahead expectations but shifts back in for 3-year ahead expectations, see Chart 13). Longer-term expectations are also becoming more concentrated around the 2% level compared with a year ago (Chart 14, left panel), while a growing number of monetary analysts see inflation stabilising at 2%, with only a small proportion seeing inflation above this target (Chart 14, right panel). Despite the surge in short-term inflation, recent research analysing the option-implied probabilities of tail events indicates that investors still fear the euro area may fall back into a deflationary trap in the future, whereas for the United States the opposite risk is higher. See Hilscher, J. Raviv Bar-Ilan, A. and Reis, R., (2022), How likely is an inflation disaster?, mimeo, London School of Economics, February. The paper also shows that in 2021 market perceptions of a high-inflation outcome rose significantly for the United States, but not for the euro area. These results (which estimate the tail probabilities for persistently very high or very low inflation using the prices of inflation options) reflect, among other things the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy regime. Brainard, W.C. (1967), —op. cit. In September 2020, for example, I made the argument that “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.” See Panetta, F. (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September. Söderström, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with Uncertain Parameters,” The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No 1, pp. 125-145. This fall is also visible in measures adjusted for risk premia at shorter horizons. In the United States and the United Kingdom measures of inflation expectations have remained broadly unchanged in recent weeks. In the past, the issue was resolved with an instrument – the Outright Monetary Transactions – designed for a situation where the main driver of fragmentation was unsound national policies, for which macroeconomic adjustment programmes were designed.\n",
       "2    SPEECH  Finding the right sequence   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a virtual policy panel on “Unwinding QE” at the first annual Bank of England Agenda for Research (BEAR) conference Frankfurt am Main, 24 February 2022 The terrible act of aggression and the shock of war that we are witnessing in the heart of Europe overshadow today’s conference. This is a sad day for Europe and the world. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. In such times of extreme uncertainty, central banks need to be a source of confidence and a reliable anchor for the economy. Therefore, we are monitoring the situation closely. My remarks today reflect the macroeconomic situation predating the war. In the euro area, inflation has proven more persistent and more broad-based than expected, labour market slack is being reabsorbed at a faster pace than anticipated and pipeline pressures continue to build up. At the same time, prospects are rising that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may herald a turning point in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this environment, monetary policy needs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices today will not jeopardise price stability over the medium term. Households and firms count on the ECB to protect their purchasing power without putting at risk the current strong recovery from the crisis. Our policy framework enables us to deliver on these expectations. Our forward guidance has explicitly defined the conditions that need to be met for policy rates to be raised. And the clear sequence with which we intend to remove monetary stimulus, if and when necessary, reduces the uncertainty about how our actions will affect financing conditions and the broader economy. In the following, I will first discuss the current outlook for inflation. I will then explain the sequencing of policy measures that we will take once the Governing Council judges that policy should be normalised and will elaborate in more detail on three aspects that are more specific to the euro area. The first regards the question as to how the inflation outlook affects the policy normalisation process. The second point relates to how the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area affects the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. And the third point provides thoughts on how our sequence may interact with conditions in sovereign bond markets and the risks of fragmentation. A qualitative and quantitative change in the euro area’s inflation outlook A year ago, there was a widely shared expectation that inflation would rise sharply in response to the reopening of our economies but would subside swiftly as the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic would fade. There was a strong conviction that the combination of statistical base effects, slowing energy price inflation and the removal of one-off tax effects would mark a turning point in the euro area’s inflation trajectory towards the end of last year. These expectations have been disappointed. Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) continued to increase both in December 2021 and in January 2022, when it reached a new historical high of 5.1% (Slide 2). In January, euro area inflation surprised to the upside for the seventh consecutive month. Today, inflation is not only higher than expected, but price pressures are also visibly broadening. Measures of underlying inflation are following an unprecedented upward trend (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The prices of around two-thirds of the goods and services included in the HICP are currently increasing at an annual rate above 2% (Slide 3, right-hand chart). Less than a year ago, this share was close to 20%. Current measured inflation would be even higher if the costs of owner-occupied housing were included. Residential real estate prices continued to increase at an alarming pace. In the third quarter of 2021, prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 9% year-on-year, an unprecedented rate of increase (Slide 4, left-hand chart). If owner-occupied housing were included in the HICP, headline inflation in the third quarter of 2021 would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. For core inflation, the difference would have been twice as much – that is, core inflation would have been 2% rather than 1.4%, which is the largest difference observed since the start of the sample in 2012 (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Looking forward, the broad-based nature of recent upward surprises, extending well beyond the energy component, implies that significant uncertainty remains as to when the inflation peak will eventually be reached. What is becoming increasingly clear is that inflation is unlikely to fall back below our 2% target this year. It may increase even further over the near term before declining gradually over the course of 2022 as energy price inflation should slow. But the decline is not going to be nearly as fast as we previously anticipated. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2% target from above, rather than from below. The start of the year has seen three broad developments that corroborate this view. From pandemic to endemic? First, there are growing signs that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may bring forward the transition towards an endemic equilibrium. Although hospitalisations are still increasing in some countries alongside elevated case counts, admissions to intensive care units and fatality rates are now only a fraction of what they were in previous waves. There is a real chance that the Omicron variant could herald an inflection point after which the global community will be able to live with COVID-19 in spite of possible recurrent episodes of high case numbers. As governments worldwide are easing contact restrictions, the remaining slack in the economy will likely be reabsorbed at a faster pace than previously anticipated, in particular in contact-intensive services where the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on business and sentiment.  The most recent survey data corroborate this view for the euro area. In February, sentiment in the services sector improved sharply, back to levels seen before the discovery of the Omicron variant. A faster and more frontloaded recovery, in turn, risks increasing pressure on wages at a time when the labour market in the euro area is already showing first signs of strain. This brings me to the second point – the recovery in the labour market.  Strong recovery in the labour market Although the pandemic is still raging through the economy, slack in the labour market has continued to decline at a notably faster pace than projected (Slide 5, left-hand chart). A year ago, our central forecast was that the euro area unemployment rate would decline, on average, to 8.1% in 2022. In December 2021, the unemployment rate stood already at 7%. We are currently witnessing the strongest labour market in the history of the single currency. The unemployment rate is at a record low and below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), while the participation rate is at a record high (Slide 5, right-hand chart). Broader labour market slack, too, for which data are lagging, was already reabsorbed, by and large, by the end of the summer of last year, as strong demand is bringing more and more people – also those at the fringes of the labour market – back into work.[1]  While total hours worked still remained below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, there are good reasons to believe that the widespread easing of contact restrictions will help accelerate progress on that front too. Survey evidence confirms the picture of a tightening labour market. A rapidly rising share of firms across all economic sectors report shortages of labour as a factor limiting production. This is now the case for about a quarter to a third of all firms, a level never before observed in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand chart). Vacancy rates across the euro area are significantly higher than before the pandemic, which is consistent with firms reporting continued strong employment demand ahead (Slide 6, right-hand chart). These developments will add to pressure on wages as our economies continue to reopen. Although negotiated wage growth remains moderate, our latest corporate telephone survey among larger firms showed that wage pressures are expected to build up fast. Euro area firms anticipate considerably higher wage increases in the near term. For 2022, their average expected wage increase is 3.5%. The survey also showed that higher input costs, such as wages, are being passed through to consumer prices at a faster pace and to a larger extent than in the past, as strong pent-up demand creates a favourable environment for protecting or boosting profit margins. A faster pass-through, in turn, implies that for medium-term price pressures it is less relevant how fast wages expand today than how fast they will grow this year and next. Pipeline pressures remain elevated Third, pipeline pressures, which affect consumer price inflation with a lag, continue to build up. Import price inflation for intermediate and final consumer goods has increased further and remains at extraordinarily high levels (Slide 7, left-hand chart). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation reached a new all-time high in November. The inflation rate of services producer prices, which are an important element in the cost structure of both manufacturing and services firms, stands at 4.3%, which is almost nine times as high as its historical average. All services sectors report stronger price pressures than before the pandemic. These pipeline pressures will fade only gradually and will likely remain a source of upward pressure for consumer prices over the foreseeable future, with most firms expecting unusual cost pressures to persist for at least another six months. In addition, in large parts of the euro area the recent surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices will only be passed through to consumer prices with a lag. There is also a lot of uncertainty whether energy inflation will decline to the extent suggested by the futures curves underlying our December projections (Slide 7, right-hand chart). Brent oil spot prices are now at their highest levels since 2014 and current futures curves are well above the levels seen at the end of last year. Gas futures prices, too, are markedly higher than in December of last year. While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.[2]  In the EU, price developments under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) signal such an impending structural shift. ETS prices have recently reached a new record high of around €90 per tonne of carbon, almost three times as high as at the beginning of 2021, and they are expected to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. It is a reminder of the challenges we are facing in anticipating potential structural shifts in the underlying inflation process that could extend well beyond the energy sector.[3]  Sequencing of policy normalisation in the euro area All in all, there have been few instances in the recent past where the information set available to policymakers has changed so profoundly and in such a short period of time as has been the case since the beginning of the year. How today’s attack on Ukraine changes the euro area outlook is highly uncertain at this stage. We are monitoring the situation closely and will carefully evaluate the consequences for our policies. Based on the macroeconomic situation predating the war, however, inflationary pressures will likely prove stronger and more persistent over both the near and the medium term. Policy optionality is therefore needed more than ever to protect price stability.[4]  Our decisions in December of last year to end net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and to recalibrate the path of future purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) have been a first important step in this direction. At our next meeting in March, we will reassess whether the current path of asset purchases remains consistent with the updated inflation outlook, and we will thoroughly evaluate the progress made towards meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. While both the calibration and the time of adjustment of our policy instruments are data-dependent, the sequence with which we intend to adjust our policy stance is not. Our sequencing is subject to three guideposts. The first is our rate forward guidance, which provides the anchor for the normalisation process. It defines three conditions that need to be satisfied in the view of the Governing Council for our key policy rates to be raised: first, inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon; second, inflation remaining around 2% durably for the rest of the projection horizon; and, third, realised progress in underlying inflation being consistent with our inflation target. The second guidepost is that we will stop net asset purchases under the APP “shortly before” we increase our main policy rates. “Shortly before” is a term that is deliberately vague. It does not indicate a pre-defined distance between the end of our net asset purchases and policy rate lift-off. It does, however, imply that we will end net asset purchases under the APP once we judge that it is sufficiently likely that the rate forward guidance criteria are going to be fulfilled over the foreseeable future, while rates are going to be raised only when these conditions are actually met. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key policy rates. Again, the notion of an “extended period” is kept open to leave sufficient optionality in order to be able to respond to changes in the inflation outlook. In principle, this sequence is not very different from the one adapted by many other central banks, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. It defines a clear succession of steps that leaves sufficient flexibility to adjust the length of time needed before activating the next step of the sequence. That said, there are three considerations that are more specific to the euro area. Adjusting policy when inflation is converging to target The first relates to the inflation outlook. A central bank that faces a significant risk of inflation being markedly above target over the medium term would need to initiate a rapid sequence of policy rate hikes to above their estimated neutral levels. According to survey and market-based proxies, this would require bringing policy rates well into positive territory (Slide 8). However, these are not the conditions that we are facing today.  Rather, the economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2% target over the medium term. The current inflation outlook therefore calls for a gradual normalisation of our policy stance, reflecting the significant progress made towards meeting our inflation target in the future. During such a process of gradual normalisation, the focus should be first on unwinding step-by-step the exceptional measures we took to fight low inflation, starting with net asset purchases. The degree to which policy will need to be adjusted over time depends on how the inflation outlook continues to evolve. The focus on ending net asset purchases first reflects, at least in part, the fact that their side effects tend to increase over time.[5]  The experience of the past few years demonstrates, for example, that balance sheet policies have a significantly larger impact on house prices than changes in short-term policy rates, thereby contributing to the measurable rise in residential real estate prices (Slide 9).[6]  Similarly, years of balance sheet expansion have caused the bond free float in some economies to decline to very low levels (Slide 10, left-hand chart). As such, an end to net asset purchases enhances the availability of safe assets that the market requires to function well (Slide 10, right-hand chart).[7]  Ending net asset purchases when inflation is robustly converging to our target also credibly underlines that our actions are solely guided by our mandate, refuting concerns about fiscal dominance. Finally, in the current environment of large imported inflation, reversing the current exceptional measures has the potential to mitigate inflationary pressures even without the usual long lag in policy transmission. Over the past years, these measures have contributed to large capital outflows from the euro area, thereby putting downward pressure on the euro exchange rate (Slide 11). The exit from these measures can thus support the currency and, for a net importer of energy, provide tangible and immediate support to euro area households and firms by improving the terms of trade. Choice of policy instruments The second aspect relates to the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. This choice crucially depends on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The euro area remains a bank-based economy. Although market-based debt financing has gained importance since the global financial crisis, bank credit remains by far the dominant source of external finance for euro area firms (Slide 12, left-hand chart).[8]  The financing structure, in turn, has important implications for how strongly a given monetary impulse is transmitted to the real economy. Recent ECB staff analysis finds that when the share of bank loans in total external finance is high, like in the euro area, real GDP growth often shows only a weak response to changes in long-term interest rates (Slide 12, right-hand chart). In other words, our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process. Most of firms’ credit is either linked directly to short-term rates in financial markets, such as the EURIBOR, or has fixed maturities of short duration. Half of outstanding loans to euro area firms have a maturity of one year or less. Long-term rates are not only less relevant for policy transmission, central banks also have only indirect control over the part that is not related to the expected future path of short-term interest rates, i.e. the term premium.  The latter is affected by a host of factors, such as inflation uncertainty, global spillovers or demand by price-insensitive investors. The stock of bonds held by central banks is just one of these factors. Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance. This is also why our sequence foresees that policy lift-off will predate with some distance a reduction of our balance sheet. Risks of fragmentation This brings me to my third consideration – the question as to whether and how changes in sovereign bond market conditions could challenge our sequencing. Despite significant progress in recent years, the euro area’s institutional architecture remains incomplete. In the absence of a common fiscal capacity, and with public debt at elevated levels owing to the pandemic, parts of the euro area remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. There are three mitigating factors at present, however. One is that the combination of a long period of historically low rates and the marked increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt has measurably reduced the sensitivity of debt to changes in market interest rates. The average interest rate will remain low for some time even if the marginal interest rate starts rising (Slide 13, left-hand chart). Second, with average interest rates remaining low, and inflation receding only gradually, the strong expected recovery over the coming years should lead to a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios (Slide 13, right-hand chart). Structural reforms and large-scale investments related to Next Generation EU should foster confidence in the capacity of euro area countries to generate sustained high growth. Third, our decision in December last year to reinvest flexibly under the PEPP provides a strong mechanism to preserve the transmission of monetary policy in the event of severe and self-fulfilling market dislocations that would jeopardise the achievement of our mandate. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter renewed negative shocks related to the pandemic. Hence, we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation, while our monetary policy stance is guided by our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Conclusion Let me conclude. The inflation outlook has firmed since the start of the year. Inflationary pressures have broadened and have become more persistent. The expected easing of contact restrictions, together with the strong recovery in the labour market and elevated pipeline pressures have increased upside risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, the shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook. In this environment, we need to carefully reflect on how much monetary policy stimulus is required for inflation to stabilise at our target over the medium term, so as to neither fall below 2% once the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic fade, nor to allow an extended period of high inflation to become entrenched over time. This uncertainty speaks in favour of a gradual and data-dependent normalisation that respects the sequence that we have communicated, with a view to reducing uncertainty about our actions and intentions.

       "3    SPEECH  Towards a stronger AML/CTF framework in the EU   Welcome address by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, during a seminar presenting the ECB Opinions on the proposed regulation establishing the AML/CFT Authority, AML Regulation, the sixth AML Directive and the Funds and Crypto-assets Transfers Regulation Brussels, 23 February 2022 The EU framework for the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing already has a long history. It is more than 30 years now since the first Anti-money Laundering Directive was published in June 1991. Since then, the framework has undergone many improvements, with the previous – fifth – AML Directive being published in May 2018.  The framework grew both in terms of the number and the forms of the regulatory instruments involved, incorporating both regulations and directives, as well as regulatory technical standards and guidelines developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Market Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. Nevertheless, the AML Directive has remained the core of the legal framework.  The ECB provided opinions on many of those legislative proposals. The ECB does not and cannot have any mandate to exercise anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. However, as my ECB Supervisory Board colleague Edouard Fernandez-Bollo aptly articulated in a recently published blog post: “Some things matter to you, even if you are not directly responsible for them.”  The EU AML/CFT framework affects the ECB’s tasks relating to the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the tasks that fall within its central banking mandate.  In particular, it is important for the ECB to factor the outcomes of AML/CFT supervision into its prudential supervisory processes. The risk of the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing is relevant for ECB prudential supervisory decisions on acquisitions of qualifying holdings in supervised entities, granting and withdrawing authorisations to credit institutions, and suitability assessments of existing or prospective managers of supervised entities. The outcomes of AML/CFT supervision are also reflected in day-to-day supervision as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.  Since the exchange of confidential information between the ECB and the AML/CFT supervisors was enabled in 2018 by an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, the ECB, as a prudential supervisor, has concluded an agreement on information exchange with more than 50 AML/CFT supervisory authorities across all Members States of the European Economic Area. This cooperation was further enhanced by subsequent amendments to the Directive in 2019, as well as by the establishment of AML/CFT colleges, in which the ECB participates as an observer. Over the past years the ECB has also been actively contributing to the work of the EBA’s AML Standing Committee. Good and efficient cooperation with AML/CFT supervisory authorities is therefore an important priority for us. Last year, following discussions in the Council of the EU, the Commission presented a set of legislative proposals for major changes to the EU AML/CFT framework: The first substantial change consists in transforming most of the requirements addressed to private entities from the AML Directive to a directly applicable EU regulation.  The second, and even more fundamental change is the establishment of a new authority at the EU level with a mandate for both direct and indirect AML/CFT supervision across all EU Member States. We see this as an important shift which has the potential to bring a more harmonised application of EU AML/CFT requirements and convergence of practices in AML/CFT supervision across the EU.  The third and most prominent change, which concerns the ECB’s central banking activities, is the introduction of an EU-wide limit to payments in cash. This type of measure has so far only been implemented at the level of individual Member States by means of national legislation. In the past the ECB has opined on a number of such national legislative measures. The legislative package published by the Commission consists of four legislative acts. The ECB was consulted on most elements of the legislative package by the European Parliament and the Council in October 2021. The ECB Governing Council recently adopted and published its opinions on all four elements of the package. My colleagues will give more details on the main themes which the ECB opinions touch upon. Most of the observations and suggestions in the ECB opinions seek to improve the framework of cooperation and information exchange with the future AML Authority, as well as the national AML/CFT authorities.  The ECB incorporated in its opinions its experience from establishing EU-level prudential supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, to the extent that it could be useful in establishing the EU-level AML/CFT supervision. I would like to highlight that the criteria for identifying the selected entities that will be under the direct supervision of the future AML Authority are relatively strict. The Commission envisages that only between 12 and 20 obliged entities will meet these criteria. Based on its experience, the ECB would strongly support amending these criteria such that a wider pool of obliged entities would be directly supervised by the AML Authority, including entities headquartered in each Member State. This would promote a common supervisory culture and convergence of AML/CFT supervisory practices.  Also, considering the strict, risk-based nature of the selection criteria, the publication of the list of selected obliged entities would be tantamount to indirectly disclosing the high money laundering risk status of selected supervised entities, sending unintended signals to the markets or creating reputational issues for selected obliged entities directly supervised by the new AML authority.  The most prominent element of the ECB opinions is the analysis of the proposed limit to cash payments. While the proposed limit of €10,000 euro does not appear problematic, the ECB brings several considerations to the attention of the co-legislators with a view to protecting the legal tender status of euro banknotes, in line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU.  Let me now hand over to my colleagues who will present the ECB opinions in greater detail.

       "4    SPEECH  Prudential pathways to Paris   Contribution by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, on the panel “Sustainable finance: what is expected from transition scenarios?” at the Eurofi High Level Seminar 2022 Frankfurt am Main, 23 February 2022 Many thanks to the organisers for letting me participate remotely in this panel alongside such distinguished speakers. And thank you to the Chair of the panel for allowing me to open the discussion with some remarks on the importance of transition planning. I fully appreciate the irony of what I’m about to say, what with you in Paris and me here on-screen, but we are all on the path to Paris. Citizens, firms, banks and prudential supervisors alike are working towards the climate goals agreed in 2015 as the EU and national governments roll out policies implementing the Paris Agreement.  In previous speeches, I have stressed the need for banks to put in place transition plans compatible with EU policies implementing the Paris Agreement – plans with concrete intermediate milestones to enhance banks’ long-term strategies and decision-making. More and more banks are already doing this themselves, while the European Commission also called for enhanced transition planning in its sustainable finance strategy published in July 2021.  For ECB Banking Supervision, the main concern that needs to be addressed by these transition plans is the level of banks’ risk exposures and the effectiveness of their controls. Have the exposures been sufficiently mitigated and are they prudent? As climate-related and environmental risks become increasingly widespread and more material, banks will, inevitably, be exposed to them, through both physical and transition risks. Banks therefore need adequate risk mitigation measures in place. This is what we need to assess as the prudential supervisor.  Introducing a legal requirement for banks to have a clear, detailed and prudent transition plan in place would increase the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory framework and contribute to maintaining a level playing field. Needless to say, we are very happy to see that this is exactly what the European Commission has proposed in its review of the Capital Requirements Directive, which is now with the co-legislators.  But it doesn’t stop there. For banks to be able to manage their transition risks adequately, they need to have information on how their customers are performing relative to a Paris-aligned transition path. This is where the European Commission’s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive comes in. The ECB welcomed this proposed directive in a legal opinion and it is now awaiting approval by the co-legislators.  The current standards on sustainability disclosure are insufficient to ensure that sustainability-related financial risks are properly understood and priced by market participants. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is a necessary step to address the gaps that currently hinder the development of appropriate sustainability policy, risk assessment and risk monitoring frameworks for the financial sector. This is because it will not only explicitly ask large banks to disclose their transition plans, it will also ask banks’ corporate clients to do the same. This last point is crucial, as it will enable banks to assess the climate-related and environmental risks in their asset portfolios. These disclosures are therefore an important element in ensuring that banks manage all material risks, in line with what we as the prudential supervisor expect them to do.  The climate-and-environmental puzzle is still highly complicated, but we can now see the pieces slotting into place. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the elements included in the Commission’s proposals are implemented in actual binding legislation entering into force without undue delay. This will smooth the path to Paris for all.

       "5    SPEECH  Central bank digital currencies: defining the problems, designing the solutions   Contribution by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, to a panel discussion on central bank digital currencies at the US Monetary Policy Forum New York, 18 February 2022 It is a great pleasure to take part in this panel on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Throughout history, money and payments have been constantly evolving. And this also holds true in the digital age. As we increasingly pay digitally and shop online, we rely less on cash. Our wallets are gradually moving from our pockets to smartphones and other electronic devices.  These changes have profound implications for the nature of money itself, raising the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies for retail use.  Today I will argue that in a digital world CBDCs are necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilising force at the heart of the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty.  But CBDCs will need to be carefully designed. To be successful, they will need to add value for users, support competition rather than crowd out private innovation, and avoid risks to financial intermediation.  Why we need central bank digital money Our monetary system is based on the complementarity of private money with public money – which is available for retail payments in the form of banknotes.[1]  Confidence in private means of payment is determined by our ability to convert private money into safe public money. This is because central bank money is a risk-free form of money that is guaranteed by the State: by its strength, its credibility, its authority.  Other types of money are liabilities of private issuers: their value is based on the soundness of the issuer and is underpinned by the promise of one-to-one convertibility with central bank money.[2] Our readiness to hold private money such as bank deposits reflects the confidence that we can always go to a branch or a cash machine and convert our deposits into cash. The fact that we can do this tells us that our deposits are safe. It reassures us that we will be able to convert them into risk-free central bank money in the future, too.  Bank runs and financial crises start when confidence in the convertibility of private money evaporates.[3] Without the anchor of sovereign money, people would constantly have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money. This would undermine confidence in the singleness of money and impair the functioning of the payments system.[4]  History provides examples for this. In times when various forms of private money coexisted in the absence of sovereign money – such as the free banking era of the 19th century – the notes issued by banks often traded at variable prices[5] and instability risks[6] required dominant banks and clearinghouses to act as quasi-central banks[7]. The consensus among central banks on the coexistence between public and private money was summarised 20 years ago as follows: “The composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency. In other words, central banks would accept neither an outcome in which central bank money crowds out private initiative, nor an outcome in which central bank money is phased out by a market mechanism.”[8]  In the digital age, however, banknotes could lose their role as a reference value in payments, undermining the integrity of the monetary system.[9] Central banks must therefore consider how to ensure that their money can remain a payments anchor in a digital world.  Some have suggested that innovative private payment solutions such as stablecoins could, if properly regulated, make CBDCs superfluous.[10] However, confidence in stablecoins would also depend on the ability to convert them into central bank money,[11] unless stablecoin issuers were allowed to invest the reserve assets in risk-free deposits at the central bank. But this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money, which would endanger monetary sovereignty.[12] Moreover, in the absence of public money, stablecoins could exacerbate the “winner-takes-all” dynamics inherent in payment markets, with adverse consequences for the functioning of the payments system.[13] And stablecoins’ potentially large investments in safe assets could affect the availability of these assets.[14] This could in turn have an impact on market functioning and real interest rates, with undesirable implications from a monetary policy perspective.[15]  Other threats to monetary sovereignty could emerge in the absence of a domestic digital currency. If a foreign CBDC were to be widely adopted, this could lead to digital currency substitution[16]. This risk would be higher for small countries with unstable currencies and weak fundamentals, especially if the CBDC were issued in a major economy.[17] But it could eventually also affect leading currencies.[18]  Such risks are not imminent, but they should not be underestimated. Just as the US dollar overtook the pound sterling as the leading reserve currency within only a decade of the end of the First World War,[19] digital innovation may give rise to powerful new foreign contenders, with disruptive consequences for those markets that are not prepared to face the digital challenge.  The widespread adoption of a foreign CBDC would increase the risk of financial transactions being based on technologies managed and supervised elsewhere, with limited oversight by domestic authorities. A system of this kind may not have sufficient safeguards against external threats, including cyber threats. It could put the confidential data of people, businesses, and states at greater risk of being misused. And it could make the information needed to counter criminal activities harder to trace.  The scenario I am describing is not one of science fiction. It is already the case in the market for crypto-assets, which are widely used for criminal activities.[20] A similar situation might affect other digital asset markets in the future. So the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted, and this will make a big difference.[21] But it may not be sufficient.  The main benefits of CBDCs  A CBDC would preserve the coexistence of sovereign and private money in a digital world. This is not an abstract benefit – it is the basis for financial and monetary stability, ensuring competition and efficiency in payment markets. But a CBDC could generate even more benefits for users.  It could improve the confidentiality of digital payments. The information contained in electronic transactions can be monetised by private companies[22], posing a threat to privacy. This risk is further compounded by big techs starting to offer financial services and by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Data protection regulation aims to prevent misuse, but cannot always keep pace with technological innovation, as we have seen in past cases of data breaches and misuse by tech companies.[23]  If a digital currency were offered by an independent public institution such as the central bank – which has no interest in exploiting individual payment data for any purpose – it could enhance, not reduce, the confidentiality of electronic payments. Potential users clearly want this: when we consulted the public on the topic, privacy was identified as the most important aspect of a digital euro.[24] Sound governance arrangements that comply with data protection regulations would ensure that payment information is only accessed for permitted purposes, such as countering illegal activities. We are cooperating with the relevant European authorities on this issue.  A digital euro would also increase choice and reduce costs, contributing to a level playing field in payments.[25] Key segments of the euro area payments market, such as cards and e-payments, are dominated by a handful of players, which strengthens their pricing power. Some estimates suggest that Europeans pay about 1.4% of GDP for payments services. In the United States, the costs are higher.[26]  One might argue that private service providers are already well equipped to offer low-cost digital payment solutions. However, the limited evidence available suggests that low-income households use digital payments less than high-income households. This is consistent with the hypothesis that digital payments remain expensive for many users.[27] And even in advanced financial systems, many citizens are “unbanked” or “underbanked”.[28] Although financial inclusion depends on several factors, such as financial and digital literacy, the cost of financial services is likely to play a role.  Our digital euro project comes with a commitment that all – including vulnerable population groups – will have access to safe public money in the digital era.  Designing a successful digital euro  The fact that CBDCs are necessary to guarantee the smooth functioning of the payments market does not mean that their success should be taken for granted. Users may lack incentives to fully appreciate such benefit and – given the vast supply of private digital monies – could show limited interest in CBDCs. Indeed, we face two opposite risks: being “too successful” and crowding out private payment solutions and financial intermediation, or being “not successful enough” and generating insufficient demand. We take both risks seriously.  To avoid interfering with the functioning of the financial system, we are considering how to make the digital euro a convenient medium of exchange but not an attractive form of investment. We are examining the pros and cons of introducing a quantitative cap on digital euro holdings[29] or a tiered remuneration that would disincentivise excessive holdings.[30] We are analysing the potential impact on monetary policy. To ensure that our digital currency would be a convenient means of payment, we are working to make it available within private payment solutions, so that people would be able to use it easily wherever they can pay digitally. We aim to level the playing field by allowing intermediaries – including small ones – to offer innovative solutions to their customers. And we are considering how a digital euro could improve financial inclusion. We are interviewing focus groups to identify the characteristics of a digital euro that would add value for users. And we are working on the technical options to reconcile different objectives such as the right of individuals to confidentiality versus the public interest in guaranteeing the transparency required to counter illegal activities; or the benefits of allowing the digital euro to be widely used versus the need to safeguard financial intermediation.  We have launched several work streams: on the design choices that can guarantee confidentiality, on the prioritisation of different use cases,[31] and on the business options for intermediaries[32]. We will cover areas such as cyber security and operational resilience.  We are interacting with all relevant stakeholders, from intermediaries to consumers, merchants and authorities. We are cooperating with the European Parliament, the European Commission and the finance ministers of the euro area countries. To get technical advice and collect a broad range of views on possible solutions, we have set up a Market Advisory Group[33] and are regularly discussing the project with the Euro Retail Payments Board[34], academics and think tanks. Bearing in mind the international implications of CBDCs,[35] we are cooperating with other major central banks. In October 2021 we launched a two-year investigation phase to define the design features of the digital currency. At the end of 2023 we could decide to start a realisation phase to develop and test the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro, which could take three years. Only thereafter will we decide whether to actually issue a digital euro.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  For decades, the complementarity of public money and private money has guaranteed stability, competition and innovation.  The digitalisation of payments cannot be ignored by central banks, which have so far provided their money only in physical form. Central banks cannot escape these transformations, nor should they underestimate the potential for far-reaching shifts that may occur.  To ensure that public money maintains its fundamental role in the digital age, the ECB has launched an investigation into the possible issuance of a digital euro alongside cash.  The digital euro is an ambitious and complex project that can improve the efficiency of the economic and financial system. We want to make it a driver of stability and inclusive progress, capable of strengthening ties between economies and financial systems around the world. Our experience may provide useful insights for other central banks. And likewise, we are keen to learn from them. I am therefore pleased to exchange views with US experts, and I am now looking forward to our discussion.    Although central bank money can also take the form of reserves (deposits that commercial banks hold at the central bank), the focus of this speech will be on cash. One-to-one convertibility with central bank money is what makes the regulated forms of money convertible with each other and is why they are perceived as interchangeable when making payments. This does not mean that the safeguards put in place to protect savings – legislation and banking supervision, deposit insurance schemes, capital markets supervision – are not important. On the contrary. They must, however, be flanked by convertibility to ensure the smooth functioning of payments and the stability of the financial system.

For instance, the notes of new banks were more heavily discounted. See Gorton, G. (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No 2, pp. 346-397. Price variability was inconvenient, as users had to consult a note reporter to monitor the value of the notes in circulation. See Eichengreen, B. (2019), “From Commodity to Fiat and Now to Crypto: What Does History Tell Us?”, NBER Working Paper Series, No 25426, January. The experience of the free banking era in the United States varied considerably among states and each had a significant number of problem banks. See Rolnick, A.J. and Weber, W.E. (1983), “New Evidence on the Free Banking Era”, American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No 5, pp. 1080-1091. In the United States, dominant banks disciplined note issuing banks by threatening them with bulk redemption of their notes, while clearinghouses regulated member bank levels of equity, reserves, and interest rates, audited members, produced money during crises and issued a form of insurance; See Gorton, G. (1985), “Banking theory and free banking history: A Review Essay”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 16(2), 267-276. See Bank for International Settlements (2003), op. cit.

While banks could continue to hold central bank money in the form of reserves, this may not prove sufficient to fully preserve the monetary anchor role of central bank money. People would be unable to use central bank money as means of exchange and would thus have little incentive to hold it. This would weaken the unit of account role of sovereign money. If the currency is not demanded by the public, the mere announcement that the central bank would make it available would not be enough to preserve its role in the economy. In history, sovereign money was at times used as unit of account but not as a medium of exchange. This was for example the case of the livre, the “imaginary money” introduced by Charlemagne in the monetary reform of the eighth century, named after the libra (pound), the sovereign money introduced by the ancient King of Rome Servius Tullius in the sixth century BC. The livre was never coined and never circulated. However, it had a fixed conversion rate with another form of sovereign money, the denier (1 livre was equal to 240 deniers), which was actually coined and actively used as means of exchange.

The value of a stablecoin is linked to a portfolio of one or more other assets (the reserve assets), including currency in the form of commercial bank deposits. Stablecoins can therefore be low-risk but not risk-free. Risks increase if stablecoin arrangements are backed by risky or opaque assets, especially in times of market turmoil.

New players, including operating platforms with huge customer bases, can exploit network effects and economies of scale to build dominant positions, creating their own closed-loop ecosystems. They may exploit customer data for private scoring and other uses. They may erect barriers to impede interoperability and use their “coins” to displace other forms of money.

While the international role of a currency will continue to depend to a large extent on the fundamentals of the underlying economy, availability in CBDC form would facilitate use in cross-border payments by reducing frictions and costs. Model simulations suggest that the share of a country’s currency in global export payments increases when it is available as a CBDC, but continues to depend to a large extent on forces such as the size and the stability of the economy and the development and efficiency of the financial sector.

In the public consultation conducted by the ECB in 2020, 43% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of a digital euro, well ahead of other features. The other characteristics highlighted in the consultation were the security of payments and usability throughout the euro area, which were ranked first by 18% and 11% of those surveyed, respectively.

Based on the Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE), the preference for cash in the euro area is significantly higher among low-income respondents. While only 36% of those with an income of €1,000 per month or less have a preference for cards or other cashless means of payment, that preference was expressed by 61% in the income bracket of €2,500 and more.

Although they are often invisible to the customer, the various layers of merchant fees can add up to some 3% of the transaction value. According to Glory Global Solutions, “Some banks tell merchants to budget for between 2.5% and 3% of the transaction valuable, but with so many variables, this is only ever a rough guide.” See Glory Global Solutions (2018),  Electronic Payments – Not As Cheap As You Think .

In the euro area there are still more than 5% of adults without a payment account. See World Bank (2017),  Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database  .  In the case of quantitative holding limits, we are considering waterfall solutions linking digital euro accounts to private money accounts, to allow payments in excess of the limit. Bindseil, U.

The impact of a digital euro on the financial system”, speech at a Bruegel online seminar, 10 February. Use cases refer to the various interactions between people, businesses, Government and machines (e.g. payments at the point of sale, online, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, etc.). Business options are naturally related to costs (fees, devices), but can also include the front end, taking into account consumers’ preference to use the current payment methods, be it their smartphone, card or cash. A digital euro should provide a similar payment experience, while also considering future innovations like QR codes, which are becoming more and more popular.

       "6    SPEECH  Towards an immersive supervisory approach to the management of climate-related and environmental risks in the banking sector   Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Industry outreach on the thematic review on climate-related and environmental risks  Frankfurt am Main, 18 February 2022 Welcome to this industry outreach event organised by ECB Banking Supervision on the management and supervision of climate-related and environmental risks, or C&E risks for short. Our focus today is the current state of C&E risk management practices in the banking sector, and the ECB’s upcoming thematic review of these risks. Over the last couple of years, we have launched several targeted actions in this direction. In 2020 we issued the ECB guide on C&E risks and in 2021 we conducted a supervisory review of banks’ approaches to managing these risks based on their own assessments. The ECB has progressively taken C&E risks into greater account in its supervision, as have banks in their business.  2022 will be the year that C&E risks become integrated in the day-to-day activities of our joint supervisory teams, who are in constant contact with banks. These risks will come to form an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with supervised entities and the supervisory review and evaluation process, the SREP. This will ultimately influence banks’ minimum capital requirements. The encompassing and integrated approach – which supervisors and banks are already very familiar with for traditional risk categories – is what I call the immersive supervisory approach to C&E risks. Along with the 2022 ECB supervisory stress test, the thematic review forms part of the ECB Banking Supervision roadmap to ensure that banks adequately incorporate C&E risk management. These supervisory activities complement the ECB’s broader C&E agenda, which includes publishing the results of an economy-wide climate change stress test, and our 2021 action plan to include climate change considerations in our monetary policy. The state of C&E risk management  Climate and environmental risks are impossible to avoid. The public knows it and the ECB knows it. The banks themselves now know it, as reflected in the outcome of their internal assessments. All banks that thoroughly assessed their exposure to C&E risks concluded that these risks are material. By contrast, not a single materiality assessment submitted by banks that reported no material risk exposure was deemed adequate. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the banks that acknowledged the materiality of the C&E risks they faced did so for both transition and physical risks. And they acknowledged that these risks are material in both the short and the long term. Despite this broad acknowledgement of the materiality of these risks, and thus the need to adequately manage them, we see that most banks still have a considerable way to go in developing their risk management capabilities. As the findings we published last year show, banks reported that 90% of their practices are only partially or not at all in line with ECB supervisory expectations. Let me repeat: 90%. This is both bad news and good news. Bad news because, at the time of their assessment, banks were a long way away from where they needed to be. But good news because half the banks we supervise already acknowledge that climate risks are an inevitable part of their day-to-day business. We therefore expect banks to analyse how C&E risks can or will affect their portfolios and products over the short, medium and long term, and under various scenarios, too. This type of forward-looking analysis of C&E risk should be basic practice, just as it would be for any other type of risk. Moreover, beyond merely formally attributing responsibilities, we still see banks making little progress towards more actively managing the C&E risks they face. Even certain banks that recognise the materiality of C&E risks have not reported any practices to either reduce or manage their level of risk. This year we want to see firm progress in how banks incorporate C&E risks in their risk management. In doing so, banks should adopt a strategic approach to managing these risks, using the full array of the risk management instruments at their disposal. This includes strategically realigning portfolios, setting clear risk appetites, developing mitigation strategies, adjusting qualitative credit criteria and quantifying and holding capital. Another key area in which banks can make progress is by actively supporting their clients in mitigating and adapting to the different types of climate and environmental risks. Moreover, banks can draw on the industry’s good practices that we shared last year in our report. In the face of data challenges and methodological uncertainties, banks have an even stronger imperative to get moving. To be clear, banks should not misconstrue the ECB’s actions as an outright call for divesting from carbon-intensive activities or from geographical regions vulnerable to physical risk. Rather, we are asking banks to fully grasp the physical and transition risks and to actively start managing them, with the aim of making their portfolios more resilient to C&E risks. Not all sectors will decarbonise overnight. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios show that certain sectors will continue to rely on carbon-intensive technologies for some time. We as prudential supervisors merely need banks to understand what the transition entails for their risk exposures to those sectors, and to reflect it in their overall risk management strategy. What we do not expect is an outright withdrawal from carbon-intensive industries, nor do we expect it to happen for every single sector or counterparty – but we do expect banks to harbour the capacity to manage the risks emerging from climate change. To draw a comparison with traditional risk exposures, we, as supervisors, would of course not expect banks to divest from all assets that entail credit risks, but we do insist that these risks are managed appropriately. C&E risks are to be managed just like any other risk; and their sound management requires sound risk controls. This is precisely one of our focus areas in the upcoming thematic review on C&E risks. Supervisory roadmap for C&E risks For several years, the ECB has identified banks’ exposure to C&E risks as one of the main vulnerabilities in the European banking sector. Assessing and helping banks address risks stemming from climate change and environmental degradation will be one of our supervisory priorities from now until 2024, albeit these risks have been on our minds for far longer. I remember giving my first speeches on this topic in late 2015 when still an executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank. So, we have already come a long way and our supervision of C&E risks will now take more concrete form. The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&E risks.  The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the banks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front.  The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C&E risks, which is a key topic of the session today. Two years after we launched the supervisory guide on C&E risks, we are conducting this thematic review to follow up on the self-assessment exercise conducted last year. Our main goal will be to assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks’ C&E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C&E risk strategies and risk profiles. Do all banks’ processes and analyses have visible consequences? Does the way in which banks actually steer their balance sheets and risk profiles reflect the materiality of C&E risks? These will be some of the core questions of this review.  As part of this exercise, we will monitor banks’ alignment with the supervisory expectations set out in the guide, and encourage banks’ progress towards the industry’s best practices. Fortunately, those practices were identified across different European banks over the last two years. They show that some banks are already doing what we are asking. The ECB is doing its part by guiding banks in their climate journey, setting forth supervisory expectations and sharing updates on good practices in the industry. In light of the efforts banks have already made in devising their action plans, as well as all the information on this topic published to date – by both the ECB and several other public and private organisations we expect to see material progress in banks’ implementation deadlines and concrete actions.  As part of the thematic review, we will also be looking more closely at the risk management practices for environmental risks such as risks to biodiversity, water stress and pollution. All have similar features and warrant a coordinated approach. Banks can make significant savings if, taking advantage of the momentum, they extend the range of their preparations to cover all these risks, and are thus ready for a new, more concrete, supervisory and regulatory environment. Our benchmark from last year shows that, as of early 2021, very few banks were looking into environmental risks beyond climate. We have highlighted this gap to banks. This year, we will assess how banks are managing their exposures to environmental risks beyond climate and follow up accordingly.  As we build our joint supervisory teams’ capacity to help banks understand and incorporate C&E risks, our supervisors will treat these risks just like any other. Last year’s review was conducted by a central team of experts, with the joint supervisory teams conducting the follow-up dialogue with the bank. By contrast, this thematic review will be fully embedded in the work of every joint supervisory team. While still backed by a central team of experts, the review will be driven from the engine room of supervision. And this is where the supervision of C&E risks will stay. Following up on the thematic review, all banks under our direct supervision will receive comprehensive feedback setting out any shortcomings identified. Combined with the observations from the climate stress test, this will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. Targeted qualitative requirements may also be imposed. As part of the review, we will also carefully check whether banks have followed up on any requirements we issued last year. The thematic review is a full-on supervisory review. As such, we also have the full set of supervisory measures at our disposal to address shortcomings. Those banks that continue to fail to conduct a materiality assessment of C&E risks or have not followed-up on earlier requirements will start noticing just that. Regulatory and supervisory framework  The ECB is taking action under its mandate and under the current prudential framework to get banks to where they need to be in terms of incorporating C&E risks into their business. Our supervisory activities are thus keeping in line with the rapidly evolving regulatory and supervisory framework.  For example, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive proposed by the European Commission will further articulate the integration of C&E risks in the legal framework and will require banks to develop transition plans and supervisors to scrutinise them. This is the next important step in risk management, which I have mentioned on previous occasions, and which will require banks to look thirty years ahead and devise intermediate targets for their risk exposures that can render their risk management practices fit for an economy that will transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.  And finally, disclosure frameworks and taxonomies are also developing rapidly to create an information architecture to enable banks to manage the risks and scale up green finance. Both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have intensive work programmes to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework can better cater for climate-related risks. One concrete example is the EBA’s recently published implementing technical standards for the disclosure of Environmental Social and Governance risks, which also require large banks to start disclosing their alignment with the IEA pathways by June 2024 at the latest for all relevant portfolios. Banks are running out of time to complete their preparations. On all these fronts, the sooner banks act, the smoother the transition will be for them, and for the economy they help support.  Conclusion  For ECB Banking Supervision, 2022 marks the third year of dedicated C&E risk activities. First, we issued our guide with supervisory expectations. Next, we asked banks to share with us their self-assessments on how their practices match our expectations. And they have indeed been very open and candid in these self-assessments, for which I am truly grateful.  Together we have learnt that there is a lot of room for improvement. Considering the importance, urgency and long-lasting nature of climate change, we are asking banks to intensify their efforts in measuring and managing C&E risks in line with our expectations. With the exercises that we are conducting this year, the prudential supervision of climate-related risks is moving closer to maturity. The thematic review is the next step in fully immersing C&E risks in the work of the joint supervisory teams and marks key progress towards their integration in the SREP. It crystalises our commitment to ensuring that the prudential supervision of C&E risks is here to stay.



Across advanced economies, the current inflation spike is proving to be broader and more persistent than initially expected, leading central banks to reassess the risk that it could become entrenched. This is no easy task, especially in the euro area.  Economic conditions in the euro area have benefited from the strong response of monetary policy and its positive interactions with fiscal policy during the pandemic. But this is not a typical business cycle, and we are not seeing a typical recovery.  The current inflation spike is for the most part not being driven by domestic factors – by an economy that is “running hot”, in other words. Demand remains below its pre-crisis trend.  Instead, the economy is experiencing a series of imported supply shocks that are pushing up inflation and depressing demand. The exit from the pandemic is characterised by global mismatches between demand and supply – in energy and goods markets in particular – with uneven effects across sectors.  As a result, past economic regularities may be a poor guide for the future.  This makes medium-term developments extremely hard to anticipate. There are forces at play that could delay the recovery and contain underlying price pressures, and others that could lead to accelerating inflation. Policy mistakes in either direction could push the economy onto an unfavourable path.  Faced with such uncertainty, there is a case for the central bank to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps in adjusting policy, so as not to suffocate the as yet incomplete recovery.  If we are to durably escape the low inflation and low growth environment that has defined the past decade, we cannot afford to waste the progress we have made so far. In the spirit of William Brainard[1], we should take small steps in a dark room. The dramatic conflict in Ukraine is now weighing negatively on both supply and demand conditions, making uncertainty more acute and exacerbating risks to the medium-term inflation outlook on both sides. In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer. And the ECB stands ready to act to avoid any dislocation in financial markets that could stem from the war in Ukraine and to protect the transmission of monetary policy.  Inflation as an imported phenomenon The recent inflation data in the euro area do not make for easy reading. Headline inflation reached 5% in January and is expected to stay above 2% for the entire year, while core inflation is at 2.3%. Inflation pressures are becoming widespread (Chart 1).[2]  To determine how monetary policy should respond, we need to understand the drivers of this inflation spike. I have previously spoken about “good”, “bad” and “ugly” inflation in this context, and each of these has different implications for policy.[3]  In short, good inflation is driven by domestic demand and wages consistent with our target, which monetary policy should seek to nurture until that target is reached. Bad inflation instead reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices and depress economic activity, which monetary policy should look through. Ugly inflation – the worst type of inflation – is driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which monetary policy should immediately stamp out. Data indicate that bad inflation is still dominating in the euro area today.  Unlike in the United States, our economy is not experiencing excess domestic demand. Household nominal income has not recovered its pre-pandemic trend and households are saving more of their income than they did before the pandemic (Chart 2). Consumer spending and investment both remain well below their pre-crisis trends (Chart 3). Inflation is largely imported, reflecting global shocks to supply and demand that are spilling over to our economy through import prices (Chart 4, left panel).  Around 60% of inflation in January was energy, of which the euro area is a net importer (Chart 4, right panel). This is the consequence of the recent extraordinary increases in oil and gas prices (Chart 5, left panel). These in turn mainly reflect shocks that compress energy supply, rather than stronger aggregate demand (Chart 5, right panel). The rise in the cost of energy has further accelerated after the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Inflation is also being fuelled by the global shift in consumer spending from services to manufactured goods at a time when the pandemic has disrupted production. This has translated into global supply chain bottlenecks, high durable goods prices and strong pipeline pressures. This effect, which also represents a supply shock for the euro area, is now being reabsorbed, but at a different pace in different economies (Chart 6).  These global supply-driven increases in prices – above all energy and industrial goods, but also food – explain a good part of the currently high headline inflation (Chart 7, left panel).  In contrast, services inflation – the most domestic inflation component – has so far largely come from high-contact sectors (Chart 7, right panel). These sectors are experiencing frictions created by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and some of them (such as transport services) are also sensitive to energy prices.

Uncertainty in the inflation outlook Imported supply shocks that underpin bad inflation increase the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook in two main ways.  First, energy-driven inflation acts as a “tax”[4] on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. This adds to the uncertainty around the growth outlook, making it harder to judge when the economy is likely to reach full capacity. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was seeing a bounceback after the slowdown created by the Omicron wave. But we were still some way short of returning to our pre-crisis GDP trend, across a range of possible estimates (Chart 8). In my view, GDP reaching the bottom end of this range would be the bare minimum needed to conclude that resources are fully utilised[5] – and current projections suggest that this will not happen until the middle of 2023.  The terms of trade tax from higher energy prices could further delay the return to that growth path. The heavier energy bill has already reduced household purchasing power by around 2% (Chart 9, left panel) and is negatively affecting consumer confidence (Chart 9, right panel). It is also eroding the financial buffers built up during the pandemic, especially for households with low incomes, reducing the degree to which dissaving can support consumption in the future (Chart 10). Second, prolonged imported price shocks make it harder to assess whether inflation is feeding into domestic price pressures. The fact that core inflation is increasing above 2% may initially seem to suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are accumulating. However, rising core inflation is partly due to higher energy prices, which are pushing up costs in almost all sectors (Chart 11). Similarly, industrial goods inflation may remain elevated in the near term due to higher input costs, but beyond that its dynamics are hard to predict. Inventory levels are starting to return to normal, which suggests that demand might have peaked. The memory of supply shortages might prompt firms to build precautionary stocks that initially prolong tensions but ultimately lead to excess inventories once bottlenecks ease. This would amplify the manufacturing cycle and the volatility of goods inflation.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now intensifying this uncertainty.  We face greater financial volatility in the short term. There is a risk of renewed market dislocations as investors anticipate the potential impact of sanctions and possible retaliatory actions. And these dislocations might be felt unevenly, threatening the smooth transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. But we also face greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the medium term. The higher energy prices triggered by the conflict in Ukraine point to a longer period of above-target inflation, while supply disruptions of raw materials and food could prove more persistent[6]. At the same time, these factors increase the terms of trade tax and depress economic confidence, aggravating downside risks to growth and further delaying the return to full capacity.

In 2021 the perceived average price change for utilities was 11%, and for transport services it was 9%. The actual inflation rates for energy items could suffer from an underestimation bias in cases of rising prices because domestic energy consumption is billed with a delay.

The path to price stability This uncertainty means the path to price stability is exposed to pitfalls on both sides. As imported inflation now looks set to last longer, we will need to see wages catch up sufficiently to avoid a further fall in purchasing power. If that does not happen, we might face an adverse scenario of a slower closure of the output gap and renewed disinflationary pressures once bad inflation subsides. However, we could be also confronted with an opposite, equally adverse scenario where high inflation proves to be so persistent that it destabilises inflation expectations. That could feed into wage negotiations and domestic price pressures, entrenching inflation above our target.  Whether the economy can avoid these risks and move along a stable path depends crucially on our policy response. In such a finely balanced situation, any errant policy measure could easily push the economy onto the wrong path and put at risk what we have achieved so far. If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery. But if we are too timid in the face of mounting signs that inflation is becoming a domestic process, we might inadvertently give the impression that we lack determination to secure price stability.  In both scenarios, we should not infer the medium-term inflation outlook from present inflation figures. We need to carefully assess the prospects for wage growth, productivity growth and inflation expectations. This requires us to cross-check forward-looking indicators with evidence of what we can observe in the real economy. So far, the labour market is not looking excessively tight, especially in comparison with other jurisdictions (Chart 12, left panel), and even a significant increase in wage growth would not put it much above trend productivity growth plus our inflation target (Chart 12, right panel).[7] Wage growth has remained moderate to date[8], perhaps reflecting workers’ concerns about job security, and the shock from the Ukraine conflict could prompt further caution. Different measures of inflation expectations also show no signs of de-anchoring on the upside (Charts 13 and 14).[9]  Therefore, the danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment. At the same time, I would like to see more evidence that improvements in labour markets are translating into wage growth consistent with our 2% target to be confident that the low-inflation scenario has fully disappeared. Indeed, a key conclusion of our strategy review was that, when coming out of a long period of low inflation, we should wait to see underlying inflation sufficiently advanced before adjusting policy, of which wages are a central component. And option-implied probabilities of tail events suggest that markets still see risks of eventually falling back into a too-low inflation regime.[10]  In the current situation, the task for the ECB is therefore twofold.  First, with the crisis in Ukraine raising uncertainty to unprecedented levels, our immediate priority is to protect the functioning of the financial sector and bolster confidence, in order to contain the impact of the shock on the economy and keep in place the conditions for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  Second, we should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps as the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer.

Note: Values were rounded to one decimal place prior to aggregation.    Accompanying the recovery with a light touch More than 40 years ago, William Brainard proposed the “conservatism principle”, which calls for cautious action when policymakers are faced with uncertainty.[11]  This principle does not apply to all forms of uncertainty. For example, when faced with deflationary shocks that risk rooting interest rates at the lower bound, it pays to act more decisively.[12] The same is true when inflation expectations are at risk of becoming de-anchored.[13] Both these considerations informed the ECB’s resolute response during the first phase of the pandemic.  And if measures to avoid market dislocations prove necessary in response to the war in Ukraine, we should intervene with equal determination, using all our instruments. In this respect, we reiterated in our February decisions that “within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability”. But when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policy on the economy, it is advisable to take small steps – and this is the case for the path out of the pandemic. Confronted with supply shocks that are both inflationary and contractionary, we should adjust our policy moderately and progressively as we receive feedback on the effects of our actions. We began reducing the pace of net asset purchases last year and we are on track to return to our pre-pandemic policy setting by September this year (Chart 15, left panel). Longer-term real yields have already returned to their pre-pandemic levels in the euro area (Chart 15, right panel).  The inflation outlook is stronger today than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, once the current crisis has abated, ensuring that monetary policy accompanies the recovery with a light touch may be consistent with a further adjustment in our net asset purchases. Beyond that, additional modifications to our stance should be considered carefully, for three main reasons.  First, in recent months euro area real yields have already risen more than in the United States, in spite of the different positions in the cycle (Chart 15, right panel). It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2% in a world of tighter financing conditions. This is especially important given that the equilibrium real interest rate is subject to large uncertainty (Chart 16), making it difficult to judge how far away we are from a neutral policy stance. Second, we need to be certain that removing accommodation too suddenly will not trigger market turmoil, as this could lead to financial markets overreacting and financing conditions tightening abruptly. This would set back the recovery in underlying inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at our target. We have already seen that, in the current environment, inflation expectations are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in the expected path of policy. Before the escalation of tensions in Ukraine, markets had brought forward their expectations of rate lift-off. This was associated with a reversal in the improvement of market-based inflation expectations (Chart 17, left panel).[14]  The fact that this decrease in inflation expectations was unique to the euro area[15] might have revealed concerns that the ECB would overreact to current inflation numbers and adjust its monetary policy too much and too quickly. These concerns were also hinted at by the shape of the €STR forward curve, which peaked in 2024 and then inverted somewhat, reflecting investors’ perceptions that the economy would be unable to sustain interest rates at those levels (Chart 17, right panel).  The end of net asset purchases in the euro area in 2018 was smooth mainly because short-term rates remained anchored by our forward guidance. We have not been in a situation before where markets are simultaneously reappraising the path of asset purchases and the path of rates, which could increase term premia along the yield curve. Moreover, markets are reappraising the tightening intentions of all major central banks at the same time, increasing the risk of undesirable spillovers on euro area financing conditions. Third, a key lesson from the previous crisis is not only that rates should not be raised prematurely, but also that doing so without the right framework in place can lead to renewed financial fragmentation. And this fragmentation could force monetary policy into a trade-off: we would face a choice between triggering an excessive tightening of financing conditions in some parts of the euro area, which would result in domestic demand that is too low, or adjusting the stance by less than would be optimal.  Today, fragmentation could result from the legacy effects of the pandemic, so we need a different mechanism for addressing it than during the financial crisis.[16] We have a framework that has served us well over the last two years, when the flexibility of our pandemic emergency purchase programme and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU instrument proved sufficient to stem fragmentation. This gives us a good indication of the direction we should now take. And we know from experience that the more credible a backstop is, the less likely it is to be used.

Faced with high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook with pitfalls on both sides, we should adjust policy carefully and recalibrate it as we see the effects of our decisions, so as to avoid suffocating the recovery and cement progress towards price stability.  That was already the case before the invasion of Ukraine, but this terrible event has made the need for prudence even greater. The world has become darker, and our steps should be smaller still.  At the ECB we stand by the people of Ukraine, who are now seeing what they hold dearest threatened by an unjustifiable act of aggression that violates the most fundamental principles of international law. That a country can be subjected to a full military invasion should steel our determination to defend those principles wherever we are, however we can.  The ECB’s role is clear: we will take any measures necessary, using all our instruments to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets. This is the duty of a central bank in times of emergency. And we will swiftly implement the sanctions decided on by the European Union. The scenes we have witnessed this past week will scar our memories forever. But I hope that, one day, we will look back on this moment and be proud that we did our duty, showed resolve and unity, and sought to uphold the universal values of peace, freedom and prosperity.    Brainard, W.C. (1967), “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 57, No 2, pp. 411-425. Around 60% of items in the inflation basket are currently above 2%, and the share of items that have seen price increases over the last three months is at a record high. Panetta, F. (2021a), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. The effect of higher energy prices is similar to that of a terms of trade tax that the euro area is paying to the rest of the world. See Panetta, F. (2021a), op. cit. Pre-crisis trends do not always represent the right benchmark for the recovery. The great financial crisis, for example, was created by excessive borrowing from the future which then had to be reabsorbed through a prolonged process of deleveraging. But the pandemic was a temporary exogenous shock which should not have significantly reduced the supply capacity of the economy. The pre-crisis growth path is therefore a reasonable standard. Panetta, F. (2021b), “Monetary autonomy in a globalised world”, welcome address at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world”, 26 April. For instance, Russia and Belarus produce large quantities of potash, Ukraine produces rare gases needed to produce lasers used in semi-conductor production, and Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of wheat. The ECB’s survey of large corporates paints a similar picture, foreseeing average wage increases to rise from around 2% in the recent past to 3% or more this year, although with significantly higher rates of wage growth in some sectors with labour shortages. See Gareis, J., Morris, R. and Roma, M. (2022), “Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies”, Economic Bulletin Issue 1, ECB. The average rate of negotiated wages growth was 1.5% in 2021 after 1.8% in 2020 as a whole, below our December projections. Consumers’ expectations, which arguably feed most directly into wage negotiations, show a distinct but temporary “hump” shape compared with January last year (the distribution in January 2022 shifts out for 1-year ahead expectations but shifts back in for 3-year ahead expectations, see Chart 13). Longer-term expectations are also becoming more concentrated around the 2% level compared with a year ago (Chart 14, left panel), while a growing number of monetary analysts see inflation stabilising at 2%, with only a small proportion seeing inflation above this target (Chart 14, right panel). Despite the surge in short-term inflation, recent research analysing the option-implied probabilities of tail events indicates that investors still fear the euro area may fall back into a deflationary trap in the future, whereas for the United States the opposite risk is higher. See Hilscher, J. Raviv Bar-Ilan, A. and Reis, R., (2022), How likely is an inflation disaster?, mimeo, London School of Economics, February. The paper also shows that in 2021 market perceptions of a high-inflation outcome rose significantly for the United States, but not for the euro area. These results (which estimate the tail probabilities for persistently very high or very low inflation using the prices of inflation options) reflect, among other things the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy regime. Brainard, W.C. (1967), —op. cit. In September 2020, for example, I made the argument that “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.” See Panetta, F. (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September. Söderström, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with Uncertain Parameters,” The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No 1, pp. 125-145. This fall is also visible in measures adjusted for risk premia at shorter horizons. In the United States and the United Kingdom measures of inflation expectations have remained broadly unchanged in recent weeks. In the past, the issue was resolved with an instrument – the Outright Monetary Transactions – designed for a situation where the main driver of fragmentation was unsound national policies, for which macroeconomic adjustment programmes were designed.</td><td>id_0001</td><td>2022-02-28</td></tr>\n",

This is a sad day for Europe and the world. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. In such times of extreme uncertainty, central banks need to be a source of confidence and a reliable anchor for the economy. Therefore, we are monitoring the situation closely. My remarks today reflect the macroeconomic situation predating the war. In the euro area, inflation has proven more persistent and more broad-based than expected, labour market slack is being reabsorbed at a faster pace than anticipated and pipeline pressures continue to build up. At the same time, prospects are rising that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may herald a turning point in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this environment, monetary policy needs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices today will not jeopardise price stability over the medium term. Households and firms count on the ECB to protect their purchasing power without putting at risk the current strong recovery from the crisis. Our policy framework enables us to deliver on these expectations. Our forward guidance has explicitly defined the conditions that need to be met for policy rates to be raised. And the clear sequence with which we intend to remove monetary stimulus, if and when necessary, reduces the uncertainty about how our actions will affect financing conditions and the broader economy. In the following, I will first discuss the current outlook for inflation. I will then explain the sequencing of policy measures that we will take once the Governing Council judges that policy should be normalised and will elaborate in more detail on three aspects that are more specific to the euro area. The first regards the question as to how the inflation outlook affects the policy normalisation process. The second point relates to how the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area affects the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. And the third point provides thoughts on how our sequence may interact with conditions in sovereign bond markets and the risks of fragmentation. A qualitative and quantitative change in the euro area’s inflation outlook A year ago, there was a widely shared expectation that inflation would rise sharply in response to the reopening of our economies but would subside swiftly as the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic would fade. There was a strong conviction that the combination of statistical base effects, slowing energy price inflation and the removal of one-off tax effects would mark a turning point in the euro area’s inflation trajectory towards the end of last year. These expectations have been disappointed. Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) continued to increase both in December 2021 and in January 2022, when it reached a new historical high of 5.1% (Slide 2). In January, euro area inflation surprised to the upside for the seventh consecutive month. Today, inflation is not only higher than expected, but price pressures are also visibly broadening. Measures of underlying inflation are following an unprecedented upward trend (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The prices of around two-thirds of the goods and services included in the HICP are currently increasing at an annual rate above 2% (Slide 3, right-hand chart). Less than a year ago, this share was close to 20%. Current measured inflation would be even higher if the costs of owner-occupied housing were included. Residential real estate prices continued to increase at an alarming pace. In the third quarter of 2021, prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 9% year-on-year, an unprecedented rate of increase (Slide 4, left-hand chart). If owner-occupied housing were included in the HICP, headline inflation in the third quarter of 2021 would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. For core inflation, the difference would have been twice as much – that is, core inflation would have been 2% rather than 1.4%, which is the largest difference observed since the start of the sample in 2012 (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Looking forward, the broad-based nature of recent upward surprises, extending well beyond the energy component, implies that significant uncertainty remains as to when the inflation peak will eventually be reached. What is becoming increasingly clear is that inflation is unlikely to fall back below our 2% target this year. It may increase even further over the near term before declining gradually over the course of 2022 as energy price inflation should slow. But the decline is not going to be nearly as fast as we previously anticipated. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2% target from above, rather than from below. The start of the year has seen three broad developments that corroborate this view. From pandemic to endemic? First, there are growing signs that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may bring forward the transition towards an endemic equilibrium. Although hospitalisations are still increasing in some countries alongside elevated case counts, admissions to intensive care units and fatality rates are now only a fraction of what they were in previous waves. There is a real chance that the Omicron variant could herald an inflection point after which the global community will be able to live with COVID-19 in spite of possible recurrent episodes of high case numbers. As governments worldwide are easing contact restrictions, the remaining slack in the economy will likely be reabsorbed at a faster pace than previously anticipated, in particular in contact-intensive services where the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on business and sentiment.  The most recent survey data corroborate this view for the euro area. In February, sentiment in the services sector improved sharply, back to levels seen before the discovery of the Omicron variant. A faster and more frontloaded recovery, in turn, risks increasing pressure on wages at a time when the labour market in the euro area is already showing first signs of strain. This brings me to the second point – the recovery in the labour market.  Strong recovery in the labour market Although the pandemic is still raging through the economy, slack in the labour market has continued to decline at a notably faster pace than projected (Slide 5, left-hand chart). A year ago, our central forecast was that the euro area unemployment rate would decline, on average, to 8.1% in 2022. In December 2021, the unemployment rate stood already at 7%. We are currently witnessing the strongest labour market in the history of the single currency. The unemployment rate is at a record low and below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), while the participation rate is at a record high (Slide 5, right-hand chart). Broader labour market slack, too, for which data are lagging, was already reabsorbed, by and large, by the end of the summer of last year, as strong demand is bringing more and more people – also those at the fringes of the labour market – back into work.[1]  While total hours worked still remained below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, there are good reasons to believe that the widespread easing of contact restrictions will help accelerate progress on that front too. Survey evidence confirms the picture of a tightening labour market. A rapidly rising share of firms across all economic sectors report shortages of labour as a factor limiting production. This is now the case for about a quarter to a third of all firms, a level never before observed in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand chart). Vacancy rates across the euro area are significantly higher than before the pandemic, which is consistent with firms reporting continued strong employment demand ahead (Slide 6, right-hand chart). These developments will add to pressure on wages as our economies continue to reopen. Although negotiated wage growth remains moderate, our latest corporate telephone survey among larger firms showed that wage pressures are expected to build up fast. Euro area firms anticipate considerably higher wage increases in the near term. For 2022, their average expected wage increase is 3.5%. The survey also showed that higher input costs, such as wages, are being passed through to consumer prices at a faster pace and to a larger extent than in the past, as strong pent-up demand creates a favourable environment for protecting or boosting profit margins. A faster pass-through, in turn, implies that for medium-term price pressures it is less relevant how fast wages expand today than how fast they will grow this year and next. Pipeline pressures remain elevated Third, pipeline pressures, which affect consumer price inflation with a lag, continue to build up. Import price inflation for intermediate and final consumer goods has increased further and remains at extraordinarily high levels (Slide 7, left-hand chart). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation reached a new all-time high in November. The inflation rate of services producer prices, which are an important element in the cost structure of both manufacturing and services firms, stands at 4.3%, which is almost nine times as high as its historical average. All services sectors report stronger price pressures than before the pandemic. These pipeline pressures will fade only gradually and will likely remain a source of upward pressure for consumer prices over the foreseeable future, with most firms expecting unusual cost pressures to persist for at least another six months. In addition, in large parts of the euro area the recent surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices will only be passed through to consumer prices with a lag. There is also a lot of uncertainty whether energy inflation will decline to the extent suggested by the futures curves underlying our December projections (Slide 7, right-hand chart). Brent oil spot prices are now at their highest levels since 2014 and current futures curves are well above the levels seen at the end of last year. Gas futures prices, too, are markedly higher than in December of last year. While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.[2]  In the EU, price developments under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) signal such an impending structural shift. ETS prices have recently reached a new record high of around €90 per tonne of carbon, almost three times as high as at the beginning of 2021, and they are expected to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. It is a reminder of the challenges we are facing in anticipating potential structural shifts in the underlying inflation process that could extend well beyond the energy sector.[3]  Sequencing of policy normalisation in the euro area All in all, there have been few instances in the recent past where the information set available to policymakers has changed so profoundly and in such a short period of time as has been the case since the beginning of the year. How today’s attack on Ukraine changes the euro area outlook is highly uncertain at this stage. We are monitoring the situation closely and will carefully evaluate the consequences for our policies. Based on the macroeconomic situation predating the war, however, inflationary pressures will likely prove stronger and more persistent over both the near and the medium term. Policy optionality is therefore needed more than ever to protect price stability.[4]  Our decisions in December of last year to end net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and to recalibrate the path of future purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) have been a first important step in this direction. At our next meeting in March, we will reassess whether the current path of asset purchases remains consistent with the updated inflation outlook, and we will thoroughly evaluate the progress made towards meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. While both the calibration and the time of adjustment of our policy instruments are data-dependent, the sequence with which we intend to adjust our policy stance is not. Our sequencing is subject to three guideposts. The first is our rate forward guidance, which provides the anchor for the normalisation process. It defines three conditions that need to be satisfied in the view of the Governing Council for our key policy rates to be raised: first, inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon; second, inflation remaining around 2% durably for the rest of the projection horizon; and, third, realised progress in underlying inflation being consistent with our inflation target. The second guidepost is that we will stop net asset purchases under the APP “shortly before” we increase our main policy rates. “Shortly before” is a term that is deliberately vague. It does not indicate a pre-defined distance between the end of our net asset purchases and policy rate lift-off. It does, however, imply that we will end net asset purchases under the APP once we judge that it is sufficiently likely that the rate forward guidance criteria are going to be fulfilled over the foreseeable future, while rates are going to be raised only when these conditions are actually met. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key policy rates. Again, the notion of an “extended period” is kept open to leave sufficient optionality in order to be able to respond to changes in the inflation outlook. In principle, this sequence is not very different from the one adapted by many other central banks, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. It defines a clear succession of steps that leaves sufficient flexibility to adjust the length of time needed before activating the next step of the sequence. That said, there are three considerations that are more specific to the euro area. Adjusting policy when inflation is converging to target The first relates to the inflation outlook. A central bank that faces a significant risk of inflation being markedly above target over the medium term would need to initiate a rapid sequence of policy rate hikes to above their estimated neutral levels. According to survey and market-based proxies, this would require bringing policy rates well into positive territory (Slide 8). However, these are not the conditions that we are facing today.  Rather, the economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2% target over the medium term. The current inflation outlook therefore calls for a gradual normalisation of our policy stance, reflecting the significant progress made towards meeting our inflation target in the future. During such a process of gradual normalisation, the focus should be first on unwinding step-by-step the exceptional measures we took to fight low inflation, starting with net asset purchases. The degree to which policy will need to be adjusted over time depends on how the inflation outlook continues to evolve. The focus on ending net asset purchases first reflects, at least in part, the fact that their side effects tend to increase over time.[5]  The experience of the past few years demonstrates, for example, that balance sheet policies have a significantly larger impact on house prices than changes in short-term policy rates, thereby contributing to the measurable rise in residential real estate prices (Slide 9).[6]  Similarly, years of balance sheet expansion have caused the bond free float in some economies to decline to very low levels (Slide 10, left-hand chart). As such, an end to net asset purchases enhances the availability of safe assets that the market requires to function well (Slide 10, right-hand chart).[7]  Ending net asset purchases when inflation is robustly converging to our target also credibly underlines that our actions are solely guided by our mandate, refuting concerns about fiscal dominance. Finally, in the current environment of large imported inflation, reversing the current exceptional measures has the potential to mitigate inflationary pressures even without the usual long lag in policy transmission. Over the past years, these measures have contributed to large capital outflows from the euro area, thereby putting downward pressure on the euro exchange rate (Slide 11). The exit from these measures can thus support the currency and, for a net importer of energy, provide tangible and immediate support to euro area households and firms by improving the terms of trade. Choice of policy instruments The second aspect relates to the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. This choice crucially depends on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The euro area remains a bank-based economy. Although market-based debt financing has gained importance since the global financial crisis, bank credit remains by far the dominant source of external finance for euro area firms (Slide 12, left-hand chart).[8]  The financing structure, in turn, has important implications for how strongly a given monetary impulse is transmitted to the real economy. Recent ECB staff analysis finds that when the share of bank loans in total external finance is high, like in the euro area, real GDP growth often shows only a weak response to changes in long-term interest rates (Slide 12, right-hand chart). In other words, our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process. Most of firms’ credit is either linked directly to short-term rates in financial markets, such as the EURIBOR, or has fixed maturities of short duration. Half of outstanding loans to euro area firms have a maturity of one year or less. Long-term rates are not only less relevant for policy transmission, central banks also have only indirect control over the part that is not related to the expected future path of short-term interest rates, i.e. the term premium.  The latter is affected by a host of factors, such as inflation uncertainty, global spillovers or demand by price-insensitive investors. The stock of bonds held by central banks is just one of these factors. Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance. This is also why our sequence foresees that policy lift-off will predate with some distance a reduction of our balance sheet. Risks of fragmentation This brings me to my third consideration – the question as to whether and how changes in sovereign bond market conditions could challenge our sequencing. Despite significant progress in recent years, the euro area’s institutional architecture remains incomplete. In the absence of a common fiscal capacity, and with public debt at elevated levels owing to the pandemic, parts of the euro area remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. There are three mitigating factors at present, however. One is that the combination of a long period of historically low rates and the marked increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt has measurably reduced the sensitivity of debt to changes in market interest rates. The average interest rate will remain low for some time even if the marginal interest rate starts rising (Slide 13, left-hand chart). Second, with average interest rates remaining low, and inflation receding only gradually, the strong expected recovery over the coming years should lead to a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios (Slide 13, right-hand chart). Structural reforms and large-scale investments related to Next Generation EU should foster confidence in the capacity of euro area countries to generate sustained high growth. Third, our decision in December last year to reinvest flexibly under the PEPP provides a strong mechanism to preserve the transmission of monetary policy in the event of severe and self-fulfilling market dislocations that would jeopardise the achievement of our mandate. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter renewed negative shocks related to the pandemic. Hence, we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation, while our monetary policy stance is guided by our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Conclusion Let me conclude. The inflation outlook has firmed since the start of the year. Inflationary pressures have broadened and have become more persistent. The expected easing of contact restrictions, together with the strong recovery in the labour market and elevated pipeline pressures have increased upside risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, the shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook. In this environment, we need to carefully reflect on how much monetary policy stimulus is required for inflation to stabilise at our target over the medium term, so as to neither fall below 2% once the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic fade, nor to allow an extended period of high inflation to become entrenched over time. This uncertainty speaks in favour of a gradual and data-dependent normalisation that respects the sequence that we have communicated, with a view to reducing uncertainty about our actions and intentions.

It is more than 30 years now since the first Anti-money Laundering Directive was published in June 1991. Since then, the framework has undergone many improvements, with the previous – fifth – AML Directive being published in May 2018.  The framework grew both in terms of the number and the forms of the regulatory instruments involved, incorporating both regulations and directives, as well as regulatory technical standards and guidelines developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Market Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. Nevertheless, the AML Directive has remained the core of the legal framework.  The ECB provided opinions on many of those legislative proposals. The ECB does not and cannot have any mandate to exercise anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. However, as my ECB Supervisory Board colleague Edouard Fernandez-Bollo aptly articulated in a recently published blog post: “Some things matter to you, even if you are not directly responsible for them.”  The EU AML/CFT framework affects the ECB’s tasks relating to the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the tasks that fall within its central banking mandate.  In particular, it is important for the ECB to factor the outcomes of AML/CFT supervision into its prudential supervisory processes. The risk of the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing is relevant for ECB prudential supervisory decisions on acquisitions of qualifying holdings in supervised entities, granting and withdrawing authorisations to credit institutions, and suitability assessments of existing or prospective managers of supervised entities. The outcomes of AML/CFT supervision are also reflected in day-to-day supervision as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.  Since the exchange of confidential information between the ECB and the AML/CFT supervisors was enabled in 2018 by an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, the ECB, as a prudential supervisor, has concluded an agreement on information exchange with more than 50 AML/CFT supervisory authorities across all Members States of the European Economic Area. This cooperation was further enhanced by subsequent amendments to the Directive in 2019, as well as by the establishment of AML/CFT colleges, in which the ECB participates as an observer. Over the past years the ECB has also been actively contributing to the work of the EBA’s AML Standing Committee. Good and efficient cooperation with AML/CFT supervisory authorities is therefore an important priority for us. Last year, following discussions in the Council of the EU, the Commission presented a set of legislative proposals for major changes to the EU AML/CFT framework: The first substantial change consists in transforming most of the requirements addressed to private entities from the AML Directive to a directly applicable EU regulation.  The second, and even more fundamental change is the establishment of a new authority at the EU level with a mandate for both direct and indirect AML/CFT supervision across all EU Member States. We see this as an important shift which has the potential to bring a more harmonised application of EU AML/CFT requirements and convergence of practices in AML/CFT supervision across the EU.  The third and most prominent change, which concerns the ECB’s central banking activities, is the introduction of an EU-wide limit to payments in cash. This type of measure has so far only been implemented at the level of individual Member States by means of national legislation. In the past the ECB has opined on a number of such national legislative measures. The legislative package published by the Commission consists of four legislative acts. The ECB was consulted on most elements of the legislative package by the European Parliament and the Council in October 2021. The ECB Governing Council recently adopted and published its opinions on all four elements of the package. My colleagues will give more details on the main themes which the ECB opinions touch upon. Most of the observations and suggestions in the ECB opinions seek to improve the framework of cooperation and information exchange with the future AML Authority, as well as the national AML/CFT authorities.  The ECB incorporated in its opinions its experience from establishing EU-level prudential supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, to the extent that it could be useful in establishing the EU-level AML/CFT supervision. I would like to highlight that the criteria for identifying the selected entities that will be under the direct supervision of the future AML Authority are relatively strict. The Commission envisages that only between 12 and 20 obliged entities will meet these criteria. Based on its experience, the ECB would strongly support amending these criteria such that a wider pool of obliged entities would be directly supervised by the AML Authority, including entities headquartered in each Member State. This would promote a common supervisory culture and convergence of AML/CFT supervisory practices.  Also, considering the strict, risk-based nature of the selection criteria, the publication of the list of selected obliged entities would be tantamount to indirectly disclosing the high money laundering risk status of selected supervised entities, sending unintended signals to the markets or creating reputational issues for selected obliged entities directly supervised by the new AML authority.  The most prominent element of the ECB opinions is the analysis of the proposed limit to cash payments. While the proposed limit of €10,000 euro does not appear problematic, the ECB brings several considerations to the attention of the co-legislators with a view to protecting the legal tender status of euro banknotes, in line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU.  Let me now hand over to my colleagues who will present the ECB opinions in greater detail.

And thank you to the Chair of the panel for allowing me to open the discussion with some remarks on the importance of transition planning. I fully appreciate the irony of what I’m about to say, what with you in Paris and me here on-screen, but we are all on the path to Paris. Citizens, firms, banks and prudential supervisors alike are working towards the climate goals agreed in 2015 as the EU and national governments roll out policies implementing the Paris Agreement.  In previous speeches, I have stressed the need for banks to put in place transition plans compatible with EU policies implementing the Paris Agreement – plans with concrete intermediate milestones to enhance banks’ long-term strategies and decision-making. More and more banks are already doing this themselves, while the European Commission also called for enhanced transition planning in its sustainable finance strategy published in July 2021.  For ECB Banking Supervision, the main concern that needs to be addressed by these transition plans is the level of banks’ risk exposures and the effectiveness of their controls. Have the exposures been sufficiently mitigated and are they prudent? As climate-related and environmental risks become increasingly widespread and more material, banks will, inevitably, be exposed to them, through both physical and transition risks. Banks therefore need adequate risk mitigation measures in place. This is what we need to assess as the prudential supervisor.  Introducing a legal requirement for banks to have a clear, detailed and prudent transition plan in place would increase the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory framework and contribute to maintaining a level playing field. Needless to say, we are very happy to see that this is exactly what the European Commission has proposed in its review of the Capital Requirements Directive, which is now with the co-legislators.  But it doesn’t stop there. For banks to be able to manage their transition risks adequately, they need to have information on how their customers are performing relative to a Paris-aligned transition path. This is where the European Commission’s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive comes in. The ECB welcomed this proposed directive in a legal opinion and it is now awaiting approval by the co-legislators.  The current standards on sustainability disclosure are insufficient to ensure that sustainability-related financial risks are properly understood and priced by market participants. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is a necessary step to address the gaps that currently hinder the development of appropriate sustainability policy, risk assessment and risk monitoring frameworks for the financial sector. This is because it will not only explicitly ask large banks to disclose their transition plans, it will also ask banks’ corporate clients to do the same. This last point is crucial, as it will enable banks to assess the climate-related and environmental risks in their asset portfolios. These disclosures are therefore an important element in ensuring that banks manage all material risks, in line with what we as the prudential supervisor expect them to do.  The climate-and-environmental puzzle is still highly complicated, but we can now see the pieces slotting into place. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the elements included in the Commission’s proposals are implemented in actual binding legislation entering into force without undue delay. This will smooth the path to Paris for all.

Throughout history, money and payments have been constantly evolving. And this also holds true in the digital age. As we increasingly pay digitally and shop online, we rely less on cash. Our wallets are gradually moving from our pockets to smartphones and other electronic devices.  These changes have profound implications for the nature of money itself, raising the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies for retail use.  Today I will argue that in a digital world CBDCs are necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilising force at the heart of the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty.  But CBDCs will need to be carefully designed. To be successful, they will need to add value for users, support competition rather than crowd out private innovation, and avoid risks to financial intermediation.  Why we need central bank digital money Our monetary system is based on the complementarity of private money with public money – which is available for retail payments in the form of banknotes.[1]  Confidence in private means of payment is determined by our ability to convert private money into safe public money. This is because central bank money is a risk-free form of money that is guaranteed by the State: by its strength, its credibility, its authority.  Other types of money are liabilities of private issuers: their value is based on the soundness of the issuer and is underpinned by the promise of one-to-one convertibility with central bank money.[2] Our readiness to hold private money such as bank deposits reflects the confidence that we can always go to a branch or a cash machine and convert our deposits into cash. The fact that we can do this tells us that our deposits are safe. It reassures us that we will be able to convert them into risk-free central bank money in the future, too.  Bank runs and financial crises start when confidence in the convertibility of private money evaporates.[3] Without the anchor of sovereign money, people would constantly have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money. This would undermine confidence in the singleness of money and impair the functioning of the payments system.[4]  History provides examples for this. In times when various forms of private money coexisted in the absence of sovereign money – such as the free banking era of the 19th century – the notes issued by banks often traded at variable prices[5] and instability risks[6] required dominant banks and clearinghouses to act as quasi-central banks[7]. The consensus among central banks on the coexistence between public and private money was summarised 20 years ago as follows: “The composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency. In other words, central banks would accept neither an outcome in which central bank money crowds out private initiative, nor an outcome in which central bank money is phased out by a market mechanism.”[8]  In the digital age, however, banknotes could lose their role as a reference value in payments, undermining the integrity of the monetary system.[9] Central banks must therefore consider how to ensure that their money can remain a payments anchor in a digital world.  Some have suggested that innovative private payment solutions such as stablecoins could, if properly regulated, make CBDCs superfluous.[10] However, confidence in stablecoins would also depend on the ability to convert them into central bank money,[11] unless stablecoin issuers were allowed to invest the reserve assets in risk-free deposits at the central bank. But this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money, which would endanger monetary sovereignty.[12] Moreover, in the absence of public money, stablecoins could exacerbate the “winner-takes-all” dynamics inherent in payment markets, with adverse consequences for the functioning of the payments system.[13] And stablecoins’ potentially large investments in safe assets could affect the availability of these assets.[14] This could in turn have an impact on market functioning and real interest rates, with undesirable implications from a monetary policy perspective.[15]  Other threats to monetary sovereignty could emerge in the absence of a domestic digital currency. If a foreign CBDC were to be widely adopted, this could lead to digital currency substitution[16]. This risk would be higher for small countries with unstable currencies and weak fundamentals, especially if the CBDC were issued in a major economy.[17] But it could eventually also affect leading currencies.[18]  Such risks are not imminent, but they should not be underestimated. Just as the US dollar overtook the pound sterling as the leading reserve currency within only a decade of the end of the First World War,[19] digital innovation may give rise to powerful new foreign contenders, with disruptive consequences for those markets that are not prepared to face the digital challenge.  The widespread adoption of a foreign CBDC would increase the risk of financial transactions being based on technologies managed and supervised elsewhere, with limited oversight by domestic authorities. A system of this kind may not have sufficient safeguards against external threats, including cyber threats. It could put the confidential data of people, businesses, and states at greater risk of being misused. And it could make the information needed to counter criminal activities harder to trace.  The scenario I am describing is not one of science fiction. It is already the case in the market for crypto-assets, which are widely used for criminal activities.[20] A similar situation might affect other digital asset markets in the future. So the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted, and this will make a big difference.[21] But it may not be sufficient.  The main benefits of CBDCs  A CBDC would preserve the coexistence of sovereign and private money in a digital world. This is not an abstract benefit – it is the basis for financial and monetary stability, ensuring competition and efficiency in payment markets. But a CBDC could generate even more benefits for users.  It could improve the confidentiality of digital payments. The information contained in electronic transactions can be monetised by private companies[22], posing a threat to privacy. This risk is further compounded by big techs starting to offer financial services and by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Data protection regulation aims to prevent misuse, but cannot always keep pace with technological innovation, as we have seen in past cases of data breaches and misuse by tech companies.[23]  If a digital currency were offered by an independent public institution such as the central bank – which has no interest in exploiting individual payment data for any purpose – it could enhance, not reduce, the confidentiality of electronic payments. Potential users clearly want this: when we consulted the public on the topic, privacy was identified as the most important aspect of a digital euro.[24] Sound governance arrangements that comply with data protection regulations would ensure that payment information is only accessed for permitted purposes, such as countering illegal activities. We are cooperating with the relevant European authorities on this issue.  A digital euro would also increase choice and reduce costs, contributing to a level playing field in payments.[25] Key segments of the euro area payments market, such as cards and e-payments, are dominated by a handful of players, which strengthens their pricing power. Some estimates suggest that Europeans pay about 1.4% of GDP for payments services. In the United States, the costs are higher.[26]  One might argue that private service providers are already well equipped to offer low-cost digital payment solutions. However, the limited evidence available suggests that low-income households use digital payments less than high-income households. This is consistent with the hypothesis that digital payments remain expensive for many users.[27] And even in advanced financial systems, many citizens are “unbanked” or “underbanked”.[28] Although financial inclusion depends on several factors, such as financial and digital literacy, the cost of financial services is likely to play a role.  Our digital euro project comes with a commitment that all – including vulnerable population groups – will have access to safe public money in the digital era.  Designing a successful digital euro  The fact that CBDCs are necessary to guarantee the smooth functioning of the payments market does not mean that their success should be taken for granted. Users may lack incentives to fully appreciate such benefit and – given the vast supply of private digital monies – could show limited interest in CBDCs. Indeed, we face two opposite risks: being “too successful” and crowding out private payment solutions and financial intermediation, or being “not successful enough” and generating insufficient demand. We take both risks seriously.  To avoid interfering with the functioning of the financial system, we are considering how to make the digital euro a convenient medium of exchange but not an attractive form of investment. We are examining the pros and cons of introducing a quantitative cap on digital euro holdings[29] or a tiered remuneration that would disincentivise excessive holdings.[30] We are analysing the potential impact on monetary policy. To ensure that our digital currency would be a convenient means of payment, we are working to make it available within private payment solutions, so that people would be able to use it easily wherever they can pay digitally. We aim to level the playing field by allowing intermediaries – including small ones – to offer innovative solutions to their customers. And we are considering how a digital euro could improve financial inclusion. We are interviewing focus groups to identify the characteristics of a digital euro that would add value for users. And we are working on the technical options to reconcile different objectives such as the right of individuals to confidentiality versus the public interest in guaranteeing the transparency required to counter illegal activities; or the benefits of allowing the digital euro to be widely used versus the need to safeguard financial intermediation.  We have launched several work streams: on the design choices that can guarantee confidentiality, on the prioritisation of different use cases,[31] and on the business options for intermediaries[32]. We will cover areas such as cyber security and operational resilience.  We are interacting with all relevant stakeholders, from intermediaries to consumers, merchants and authorities. We are cooperating with the European Parliament, the European Commission and the finance ministers of the euro area countries. To get technical advice and collect a broad range of views on possible solutions, we have set up a Market Advisory Group[33] and are regularly discussing the project with the Euro Retail Payments Board[34], academics and think tanks. Bearing in mind the international implications of CBDCs,[35] we are cooperating with other major central banks. In October 2021 we launched a two-year investigation phase to define the design features of the digital currency. At the end of 2023 we could decide to start a realisation phase to develop and test the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro, which could take three years. Only thereafter will we decide whether to actually issue a digital euro.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  For decades, the complementarity of public money and private money has guaranteed stability, competition and innovation.  The digitalisation of payments cannot be ignored by central banks, which have so far provided their money only in physical form. Central banks cannot escape these transformations, nor should they underestimate the potential for far-reaching shifts that may occur.  To ensure that public money maintains its fundamental role in the digital age, the ECB has launched an investigation into the possible issuance of a digital euro alongside cash.  The digital euro is an ambitious and complex project that can improve the efficiency of the economic and financial system. We want to make it a driver of stability and inclusive progress, capable of strengthening ties between economies and financial systems around the world. Our experience may provide useful insights for other central banks. And likewise, we are keen to learn from them. I am therefore pleased to exchange views with US experts, and I am now looking forward to our discussion.    Although central bank money can also take the form of reserves (deposits that commercial banks hold at the central bank), the focus of this speech will be on cash. One-to-one convertibility with central bank money is what makes the regulated forms of money convertible with each other and is why they are perceived as interchangeable when making payments. This does not mean that the safeguards put in place to protect savings – legislation and banking supervision, deposit insurance schemes, capital markets supervision – are not important. On the contrary. They must, however, be flanked by convertibility to ensure the smooth functioning of payments and the stability of the financial system. On the singleness of money see Bank for International Settlements (2003),  The role of central bank money in payment systems , Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, August. For instance, the notes of new banks were more heavily discounted. See Gorton, G. (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No 2, pp. 346-397. Price variability was inconvenient, as users had to consult a note reporter to monitor the value of the notes in circulation. See Eichengreen, B. (2019), “From Commodity to Fiat and Now to Crypto: What Does History Tell Us?”, NBER Working Paper Series, No 25426, January. The experience of the free banking era in the United States varied considerably among states and each had a significant number of problem banks. See Rolnick, A.J. and Weber, W.E. (1983), “New Evidence on the Free Banking Era”, American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No 5, pp. 1080-1091. In the United States, dominant banks disciplined note issuing banks by threatening them with bulk redemption of their notes, while clearinghouses regulated member bank levels of equity, reserves, and interest rates, audited members, produced money during crises and issued a form of insurance; See Gorton, G. (1985), “Banking theory and free banking history: A Review Essay”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 16(2), 267-276. See Bank for International Settlements (2003), op. cit. For an overview of the role of central bank money over the past 20 years, see Bindseil, U., and Terol, I (2020), “The evolving role of central bank money in payments”, Central Banking, 15 July. While banks could continue to hold central bank money in the form of reserves, this may not prove sufficient to fully preserve the monetary anchor role of central bank money. People would be unable to use central bank money as means of exchange and would thus have little incentive to hold it. This would weaken the unit of account role of sovereign money. If the currency is not demanded by the public, the mere announcement that the central bank would make it available would not be enough to preserve its role in the economy. In history, sovereign money was at times used as unit of account but not as a medium of exchange. This was for example the case of the livre, the “imaginary money” introduced by Charlemagne in the monetary reform of the eighth century, named after the libra (pound), the sovereign money introduced by the ancient King of Rome Servius Tullius in the sixth century BC. The livre was never coined and never circulated. However, it had a fixed conversion rate with another form of sovereign money, the denier (1 livre was equal to 240 deniers), which was actually coined and actively used as means of exchange.

The value of a stablecoin is linked to a portfolio of one or more other assets (the reserve assets), including currency in the form of commercial bank deposits. Stablecoins can therefore be low-risk but not risk-free. Risks increase if stablecoin arrangements are backed by risky or opaque assets, especially in times of market turmoil.

New players, including operating platforms with huge customer bases, can exploit network effects and economies of scale to build dominant positions, creating their own closed-loop ecosystems. They may exploit customer data for private scoring and other uses. They may erect barriers to impede interoperability and use their “coins” to displace other forms of money.

While the international role of a currency will continue to depend to a large extent on the fundamentals of the underlying economy, availability in CBDC form would facilitate use in cross-border payments by reducing frictions and costs. Model simulations suggest that the share of a country’s currency in global export payments increases when it is available as a CBDC, but continues to depend to a large extent on forces such as the size and the stability of the economy and the development and efficiency of the financial sector.

The European Union is revising the regulation, supervision and oversight of digital finance with the proposed Regulation of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and the ECB’s new payment oversight framework (PISA). The discussion on regulatory steps is also ongoing in other advanced economies, e.g. in the United States.

Beyond the well-known case of Oxford Analytica, big tech firms are facing increased criticism over revelations that staff and contractors listened to audio recordings of people speaking to virtual assistants, and voice chats recorded on messenger apps. Even children were affected: one major video-sharing app popular among young people was heavily fined in 2019 by the US Federal Trade Commission for collecting personal data from children under 13. See New Scientist (2019),  Big tech data abuse capped off Silicon Valley's decade-long fall , 18 December. In the public consultation conducted by the ECB in 2020, 43% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of a digital euro, well ahead of other features. The other characteristics highlighted in the consultation were the security of payments and usability throughout the euro area, which were ranked first by 18% and 11% of those surveyed, respectively. See Panetta, F. (2021), “A digital euro to meet the expectations of Europeans”, introductory remarks at the ECON Committee of the European Parliament, 14 April. See Panetta, F.

See McKinsey (2020),  The 2020 McKinsey Global Payments Report.  Based on the Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE), the preference for cash in the euro area is significantly higher among low-income respondents. While only 36% of those with an income of €1,000 per month or less have a preference for cards or other cashless means of payment, that preference was expressed by 61% in the income bracket of €2,500 and more. See Panetta, F. (2021), “Cash still king in times of COVID-19”, speech at the Deutsche Bundesbank’s 5th International Cash Conference on “Cash in times of turmoil”, 15 June. Although they are often invisible to the customer, the various layers of merchant fees can add up to some 3% of the transaction value. According to Glory Global Solutions, “Some banks tell merchants to budget for between 2.5% and 3% of the transaction valuable, but with so many variables, this is only ever a rough guide.” See Glory Global Solutions (2018),  Electronic Payments – Not As Cheap As You Think . In the United States, 6% of adults do not have a checking, savings, or money market account. See Federal Reserve (2019),  Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2018 - May 2019 . In the euro area there are still more than 5% of adults without a payment account. See World Bank (2017),  Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database  .  In the case of quantitative holding limits, we are considering waterfall solutions linking digital euro accounts to private money accounts, to allow payments in excess of the limit. Bindseil, U.

Use cases refer to the various interactions between people, businesses, Government and machines (e.g. payments at the point of sale, online, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, etc.). Business options are naturally related to costs (fees, devices), but can also include the front end, taking into account consumers’ preference to use the current payment methods, be it their smartphone, card or cash. A digital euro should provide a similar payment experience, while also considering future innovations like QR codes, which are becoming more and more popular. The Market Advisory Group includes 30 professionals from the retail payments industry and provides advice on the design and potential role of a digital euro in the payments ecosystem.

Our focus today is the current state of C&amp;E risk management practices in the banking sector, and the ECB’s upcoming thematic review of these risks. Over the last couple of years, we have launched several targeted actions in this direction. In 2020 we issued the ECB guide on C&amp;E risks and in 2021 we conducted a supervisory review of banks’ approaches to managing these risks based on their own assessments. The ECB has progressively taken C&amp;E risks into greater account in its supervision, as have banks in their business.  2022 will be the year that C&amp;E risks become integrated in the day-to-day activities of our joint supervisory teams, who are in constant contact with banks. These risks will come to form an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with supervised entities and the supervisory review and evaluation process, the SREP. This will ultimately influence banks’ minimum capital requirements. The encompassing and integrated approach – which supervisors and banks are already very familiar with for traditional risk categories – is what I call the immersive supervisory approach to C&amp;E risks. Along with the 2022 ECB supervisory stress test, the thematic review forms part of the ECB Banking Supervision roadmap to ensure that banks adequately incorporate C&amp;E risk management. These supervisory activities complement the ECB’s broader C&amp;E agenda, which includes publishing the results of an economy-wide climate change stress test, and our 2021 action plan to include climate change considerations in our monetary policy. The state of C&amp;E risk management  Climate and environmental risks are impossible to avoid. The public knows it and the ECB knows it. The banks themselves now know it, as reflected in the outcome of their internal assessments. All banks that thoroughly assessed their exposure to C&amp;E risks concluded that these risks are material. By contrast, not a single materiality assessment submitted by banks that reported no material risk exposure was deemed adequate. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the banks that acknowledged the materiality of the C&amp;E risks they faced did so for both transition and physical risks. And they acknowledged that these risks are material in both the short and the long term. Despite this broad acknowledgement of the materiality of these risks, and thus the need to adequately manage them, we see that most banks still have a considerable way to go in developing their risk management capabilities. As the findings we published last year show, banks reported that 90% of their practices are only partially or not at all in line with ECB supervisory expectations. Let me repeat: 90%. This is both bad news and good news. Bad news because, at the time of their assessment, banks were a long way away from where they needed to be. But good news because half the banks we supervise already acknowledge that climate risks are an inevitable part of their day-to-day business. We therefore expect banks to analyse how C&amp;E risks can or will affect their portfolios and products over the short, medium and long term, and under various scenarios, too. This type of forward-looking analysis of C&amp;E risk should be basic practice, just as it would be for any other type of risk. Moreover, beyond merely formally attributing responsibilities, we still see banks making little progress towards more actively managing the C&amp;E risks they face. Even certain banks that recognise the materiality of C&amp;E risks have not reported any practices to either reduce or manage their level of risk. This year we want to see firm progress in how banks incorporate C&amp;E risks in their risk management. In doing so, banks should adopt a strategic approach to managing these risks, using the full array of the risk management instruments at their disposal. This includes strategically realigning portfolios, setting clear risk appetites, developing mitigation strategies, adjusting qualitative credit criteria and quantifying and holding capital. Another key area in which banks can make progress is by actively supporting their clients in mitigating and adapting to the different types of climate and environmental risks. Moreover, banks can draw on the industry’s good practices that we shared last year in our report. In the face of data challenges and methodological uncertainties, banks have an even stronger imperative to get moving. To be clear, banks should not misconstrue the ECB’s actions as an outright call for divesting from carbon-intensive activities or from geographical regions vulnerable to physical risk. Rather, we are asking banks to fully grasp the physical and transition risks and to actively start managing them, with the aim of making their portfolios more resilient to C&amp;E risks. Not all sectors will decarbonise overnight. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios show that certain sectors will continue to rely on carbon-intensive technologies for some time. We as prudential supervisors merely need banks to understand what the transition entails for their risk exposures to those sectors, and to reflect it in their overall risk management strategy. What we do not expect is an outright withdrawal from carbon-intensive industries, nor do we expect it to happen for every single sector or counterparty – but we do expect banks to harbour the capacity to manage the risks emerging from climate change. To draw a comparison with traditional risk exposures, we, as supervisors, would of course not expect banks to divest from all assets that entail credit risks, but we do insist that these risks are managed appropriately. C&amp;E risks are to be managed just like any other risk; and their sound management requires sound risk controls. This is precisely one of our focus areas in the upcoming thematic review on C&amp;E risks. Supervisory roadmap for C&amp;E risks For several years, the ECB has identified banks’ exposure to C&amp;E risks as one of the main vulnerabilities in the European banking sector. Assessing and helping banks address risks stemming from climate change and environmental degradation will be one of our supervisory priorities from now until 2024, albeit these risks have been on our minds for far longer. I remember giving my first speeches on this topic in late 2015 when still an executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank. So, we have already come a long way and our supervision of C&amp;E risks will now take more concrete form. The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&amp;E risks.  The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&amp;E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the banks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front.  The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C&amp;E risks, which is a key topic of the session today. Two years after we launched the supervisory guide on C&amp;E risks, we are conducting this thematic review to follow up on the self-assessment exercise conducted last year. Our main goal will be to assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks’ C&amp;E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C&amp;E risk strategies and risk profiles. Do all banks’ processes and analyses have visible consequences? Does the way in which banks actually steer their balance sheets and risk profiles reflect the materiality of C&amp;E risks? These will be some of the core questions of this review.  As part of this exercise, we will monitor banks’ alignment with the supervisory expectations set out in the guide, and encourage banks’ progress towards the industry’s best practices. Fortunately, those practices were identified across different European banks over the last two years. They show that some banks are already doing what we are asking. The ECB is doing its part by guiding banks in their climate journey, setting forth supervisory expectations and sharing updates on good practices in the industry. In light of the efforts banks have already made in devising their action plans, as well as all the information on this topic published to date – by both the ECB and several other public and private organisations we expect to see material progress in banks’ implementation deadlines and concrete actions.  As part of the thematic review, we will also be looking more closely at the risk management practices for environmental risks such as risks to biodiversity, water stress and pollution. All have similar features and warrant a coordinated approach. Banks can make significant savings if, taking advantage of the momentum, they extend the range of their preparations to cover all these risks, and are thus ready for a new, more concrete, supervisory and regulatory environment. Our benchmark from last year shows that, as of early 2021, very few banks were looking into environmental risks beyond climate. We have highlighted this gap to banks. This year, we will assess how banks are managing their exposures to environmental risks beyond climate and follow up accordingly.  As we build our joint supervisory teams’ capacity to help banks understand and incorporate C&amp;E risks, our supervisors will treat these risks just like any other. Last year’s review was conducted by a central team of experts, with the joint supervisory teams conducting the follow-up dialogue with the bank. By contrast, this thematic review will be fully embedded in the work of every joint supervisory team. While still backed by a central team of experts, the review will be driven from the engine room of supervision. And this is where the supervision of C&amp;E risks will stay. Following up on the thematic review, all banks under our direct supervision will receive comprehensive feedback setting out any shortcomings identified. Combined with the observations from the climate stress test, this will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. Targeted qualitative requirements may also be imposed. As part of the review, we will also carefully check whether banks have followed up on any requirements we issued last year. The thematic review is a full-on supervisory review. As such, we also have the full set of supervisory measures at our disposal to address shortcomings. Those banks that continue to fail to conduct a materiality assessment of C&amp;E risks or have not followed-up on earlier requirements will start noticing just that. Regulatory and supervisory framework  The ECB is taking action under its mandate and under the current prudential framework to get banks to where they need to be in terms of incorporating C&amp;E risks into their business. Our supervisory activities are thus keeping in line with the rapidly evolving regulatory and supervisory framework.  For example, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive proposed by the European Commission will further articulate the integration of C&amp;E risks in the legal framework and will require banks to develop transition plans and supervisors to scrutinise them. This is the next important step in risk management, which I have mentioned on previous occasions, and which will require banks to look thirty years ahead and devise intermediate targets for their risk exposures that can render their risk management practices fit for an economy that will transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.  And finally, disclosure frameworks and taxonomies are also developing rapidly to create an information architecture to enable banks to manage the risks and scale up green finance. Both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have intensive work programmes to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework can better cater for climate-related risks. One concrete example is the EBA’s recently published implementing technical standards for the disclosure of Environmental Social and Governance risks, which also require large banks to start disclosing their alignment with the IEA pathways by June 2024 at the latest for all relevant portfolios. Banks are running out of time to complete their preparations. On all these fronts, the sooner banks act, the smoother the transition will be for them, and for the economy they help support.  Conclusion  For ECB Banking Supervision, 2022 marks the third year of dedicated C&amp;E risk activities. First, we issued our guide with supervisory expectations. Next, we asked banks to share with us their self-assessments on how their practices match our expectations. And they have indeed been very open and candid in these self-assessments, for which I am truly grateful.  Together we have learnt that there is a lot of room for improvement. Considering the importance, urgency and long-lasting nature of climate change, we are asking banks to intensify their efforts in measuring and managing C&amp;E risks in line with our expectations. With the exercises that we are conducting this year, the prudential supervision of climate-related risks is moving closer to maturity. The thematic review is the next step in fully immersing C&amp;E risks in the work of the joint supervisory teams and marks key progress towards their integration in the SREP. It crystalises our commitment to ensuring that the prudential supervision of C&amp;E risks is here to stay.



Across advanced economies, the current inflation spike is proving to be broader and more persistent than initially expected, leading central banks to reassess the risk that it could become entrenched. This is no easy task, especially in the euro area.  Economic conditions in the euro area have benefited from the strong response of monetary policy and its positive interactions with fiscal policy during the pandemic. But this is not a typical business cycle, and we are not seeing a typical recovery.  The current inflation spike is for the most part not being driven by domestic factors – by an economy that is “running hot”, in other words. Demand remains below its pre-crisis trend.  Instead, the economy is experiencing a series of imported supply shocks that are pushing up inflation and depressing demand. The exit from the pandemic is characterised by global mismatches between demand and supply – in energy and goods markets in particular – with uneven effects across sectors.  As a result, past economic regularities may be a poor guide for the future.  This makes medium-term developments extremely hard to anticipate. There are forces at play that could delay the recovery and contain underlying price pressures, and others that could lead to accelerating inflation. Policy mistakes in either direction could push the economy onto an unfavourable path.  Faced with such uncertainty, there is a case for the central bank to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps in adjusting policy, so as not to suffocate the as yet incomplete recovery.  If we are to durably escape the low inflation and low growth environment that has defined the past decade, we cannot afford to waste the progress we have made so far. In the spirit of William Brainard{[}1{]}, we should take small steps in a dark room. The dramatic conflict in Ukraine is now weighing negatively on both supply and demand conditions, making uncertainty more acute and exacerbating risks to the medium-term inflation outlook on both sides. In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer. And the ECB stands ready to act to avoid any dislocation in financial markets that could stem from the war in Ukraine and to protect the transmission of monetary policy.  Inflation as an imported phenomenon The recent inflation data in the euro area do not make for easy reading. Headline inflation reached 5\\% in January and is expected to stay above 2\\% for the entire year, while core inflation is at 2.3\\%. Inflation pressures are becoming widespread (Chart 1).{[}2{]}  To determine how monetary policy should respond, we need to understand the drivers of this inflation spike. I have previously spoken about “good”, “bad” and “ugly” inflation in this context, and each of these has different implications for policy.{[}3{]}  In short, good inflation is driven by domestic demand and wages consistent with our target, which monetary policy should seek to nurture until that target is reached. Bad inflation instead reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices and depress economic activity, which monetary policy should look through. Ugly inflation – the worst type of inflation – is driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which monetary policy should immediately stamp out. Data indicate that bad inflation is still dominating in the euro area today.  Unlike in the United States, our economy is not experiencing excess domestic demand. Household nominal income has not recovered its pre-pandemic trend and households are saving more of their income than they did before the pandemic (Chart 2). Consumer spending and investment both remain well below their pre-crisis trends (Chart 3). Inflation is largely imported, reflecting global shocks to supply and demand that are spilling over to our economy through import prices (Chart 4, left panel).  Around 60\\% of inflation in January was energy, of which the euro area is a net importer (Chart 4, right panel). This is the consequence of the recent extraordinary increases in oil and gas prices (Chart 5, left panel). These in turn mainly reflect shocks that compress energy supply, rather than stronger aggregate demand (Chart 5, right panel). The rise in the cost of energy has further accelerated after the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Inflation is also being fuelled by the global shift in consumer spending from services to manufactured goods at a time when the pandemic has disrupted production. This has translated into global supply chain bottlenecks, high durable goods prices and strong pipeline pressures. This effect, which also represents a supply shock for the euro area, is now being reabsorbed, but at a different pace in different economies (Chart 6).  These global supply-driven increases in prices – above all energy and industrial goods, but also food – explain a good part of the currently high headline inflation (Chart 7, left panel).  In contrast, services inflation – the most domestic inflation component – has so far largely come from high-contact sectors (Chart 7, right panel). These sectors are experiencing frictions created by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and some of them (such as transport services) are also sensitive to energy prices.

Uncertainty in the inflation outlook Imported supply shocks that underpin bad inflation increase the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook in two main ways.  First, energy-driven inflation acts as a “tax”{[}4{]} on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. This adds to the uncertainty around the growth outlook, making it harder to judge when the economy is likely to reach full capacity. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was seeing a bounceback after the slowdown created by the Omicron wave. But we were still some way short of returning to our pre-crisis GDP trend, across a range of possible estimates (Chart 8). In my view, GDP reaching the bottom end of this range would be the bare minimum needed to conclude that resources are fully utilised{[}5{]} – and current projections suggest that this will not happen until the middle of 2023.  The terms of trade tax from higher energy prices could further delay the return to that growth path. The heavier energy bill has already reduced household purchasing power by around 2\\% (Chart 9, left panel) and is negatively affecting consumer confidence (Chart 9, right panel). It is also eroding the financial buffers built up during the pandemic, especially for households with low incomes, reducing the degree to which dissaving can support consumption in the future (Chart 10). Second, prolonged imported price shocks make it harder to assess whether inflation is feeding into domestic price pressures. The fact that core inflation is increasing above 2\\% may initially seem to suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are accumulating. However, rising core inflation is partly due to higher energy prices, which are pushing up costs in almost all sectors (Chart 11). Similarly, industrial goods inflation may remain elevated in the near term due to higher input costs, but beyond that its dynamics are hard to predict. Inventory levels are starting to return to normal, which suggests that demand might have peaked. The memory of supply shortages might prompt firms to build precautionary stocks that initially prolong tensions but ultimately lead to excess inventories once bottlenecks ease. This would amplify the manufacturing cycle and the volatility of goods inflation.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now intensifying this uncertainty.  We face greater financial volatility in the short term. There is a risk of renewed market dislocations as investors anticipate the potential impact of sanctions and possible retaliatory actions. And these dislocations might be felt unevenly, threatening the smooth transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. But we also face greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the medium term. The higher energy prices triggered by the conflict in Ukraine point to a longer period of above-target inflation, while supply disruptions of raw materials and food could prove more persistent{[}6{]}. At the same time, these factors increase the terms of trade tax and depress economic confidence, aggravating downside risks to growth and further delaying the return to full capacity.

Chart 9 Impact of “bad” inflation on demand    Sources: Left panel: ECB and ECB staff calculations; right panel: European Commission. Notes: Changes in purchasing power due to energy price fluctuations are computed as the year-on-year percentage change in the real price of energy, weighted by the nominal energy expenditure share (see Edelstein, P. and Kilian, L. (2009), “How sensitive are consumer expenditures to retail energy prices?”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 56, No 6, pp. 766-779). A negative value indicates a loss in consumer purchasing power.

Notes: The chart refers to average aggregate effects across the income distribution, to savings cut for those households that have positive savings and rely on them to face the shock, and to dissaving for households that do not have positive savings and thus rely on alternative sources, like accumulated savings or payment deferrals, to face the shock. In 2021 the perceived average price change for utilities was 11\\%, and for transport services it was 9\\%. The actual inflation rates for energy items could suffer from an underestimation bias in cases of rising prices because domestic energy consumption is billed with a delay. The latest observations are for January 2022.

The path to price stability This uncertainty means the path to price stability is exposed to pitfalls on both sides. As imported inflation now looks set to last longer, we will need to see wages catch up sufficiently to avoid a further fall in purchasing power. If that does not happen, we might face an adverse scenario of a slower closure of the output gap and renewed disinflationary pressures once bad inflation subsides. However, we could be also confronted with an opposite, equally adverse scenario where high inflation proves to be so persistent that it destabilises inflation expectations. That could feed into wage negotiations and domestic price pressures, entrenching inflation above our target.  Whether the economy can avoid these risks and move along a stable path depends crucially on our policy response. In such a finely balanced situation, any errant policy measure could easily push the economy onto the wrong path and put at risk what we have achieved so far. If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery. But if we are too timid in the face of mounting signs that inflation is becoming a domestic process, we might inadvertently give the impression that we lack determination to secure price stability.  In both scenarios, we should not infer the medium-term inflation outlook from present inflation figures. We need to carefully assess the prospects for wage growth, productivity growth and inflation expectations. This requires us to cross-check forward-looking indicators with evidence of what we can observe in the real economy. So far, the labour market is not looking excessively tight, especially in comparison with other jurisdictions (Chart 12, left panel), and even a significant increase in wage growth would not put it much above trend productivity growth plus our inflation target (Chart 12, right panel).{[}7{]} Wage growth has remained moderate to date{[}8{]}, perhaps reflecting workers’ concerns about job security, and the shock from the Ukraine conflict could prompt further caution. Different measures of inflation expectations also show no signs of de-anchoring on the upside (Charts 13 and 14).{[}9{]}  Therefore, the danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment. At the same time, I would like to see more evidence that improvements in labour markets are translating into wage growth consistent with our 2\\% target to be confident that the low-inflation scenario has fully disappeared. Indeed, a key conclusion of our strategy review was that, when coming out of a long period of low inflation, we should wait to see underlying inflation sufficiently advanced before adjusting policy, of which wages are a central component. And option-implied probabilities of tail events suggest that markets still see risks of eventually falling back into a too-low inflation regime.{[}10{]}  In the current situation, the task for the ECB is therefore twofold.  First, with the crisis in Ukraine raising uncertainty to unprecedented levels, our immediate priority is to protect the functioning of the financial sector and bolster confidence, in order to contain the impact of the shock on the economy and keep in place the conditions for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  Second, we should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps as the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer.

Note: Values were rounded to one decimal place prior to aggregation.    Accompanying the recovery with a light touch More than 40 years ago, William Brainard proposed the “conservatism principle”, which calls for cautious action when policymakers are faced with uncertainty.{[}11{]}  This principle does not apply to all forms of uncertainty. For example, when faced with deflationary shocks that risk rooting interest rates at the lower bound, it pays to act more decisively.{[}12{]} The same is true when inflation expectations are at risk of becoming de-anchored.{[}13{]} Both these considerations informed the ECB’s resolute response during the first phase of the pandemic.  And if measures to avoid market dislocations prove necessary in response to the war in Ukraine, we should intervene with equal determination, using all our instruments. In this respect, we reiterated in our February decisions that “within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability”. But when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policy on the economy, it is advisable to take small steps – and this is the case for the path out of the pandemic. Confronted with supply shocks that are both inflationary and contractionary, we should adjust our policy moderately and progressively as we receive feedback on the effects of our actions. We began reducing the pace of net asset purchases last year and we are on track to return to our pre-pandemic policy setting by September this year (Chart 15, left panel). Longer-term real yields have already returned to their pre-pandemic levels in the euro area (Chart 15, right panel).  The inflation outlook is stronger today than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, once the current crisis has abated, ensuring that monetary policy accompanies the recovery with a light touch may be consistent with a further adjustment in our net asset purchases. Beyond that, additional modifications to our stance should be considered carefully, for three main reasons.  First, in recent months euro area real yields have already risen more than in the United States, in spite of the different positions in the cycle (Chart 15, right panel). It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2\\% in a world of tighter financing conditions. This is especially important given that the equilibrium real interest rate is subject to large uncertainty (Chart 16), making it difficult to judge how far away we are from a neutral policy stance. Second, we need to be certain that removing accommodation too suddenly will not trigger market turmoil, as this could lead to financial markets overreacting and financing conditions tightening abruptly. This would set back the recovery in underlying inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at our target. We have already seen that, in the current environment, inflation expectations are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in the expected path of policy. Before the escalation of tensions in Ukraine, markets had brought forward their expectations of rate lift-off. This was associated with a reversal in the improvement of market-based inflation expectations (Chart 17, left panel).{[}14{]}  The fact that this decrease in inflation expectations was unique to the euro area{[}15{]} might have revealed concerns that the ECB would overreact to current inflation numbers and adjust its monetary policy too much and too quickly. These concerns were also hinted at by the shape of the €STR forward curve, which peaked in 2024 and then inverted somewhat, reflecting investors’ perceptions that the economy would be unable to sustain interest rates at those levels (Chart 17, right panel).  The end of net asset purchases in the euro area in 2018 was smooth mainly because short-term rates remained anchored by our forward guidance. We have not been in a situation before where markets are simultaneously reappraising the path of asset purchases and the path of rates, which could increase term premia along the yield curve. Moreover, markets are reappraising the tightening intentions of all major central banks at the same time, increasing the risk of undesirable spillovers on euro area financing conditions. Third, a key lesson from the previous crisis is not only that rates should not be raised prematurely, but also that doing so without the right framework in place can lead to renewed financial fragmentation. And this fragmentation could force monetary policy into a trade-off: we would face a choice between triggering an excessive tightening of financing conditions in some parts of the euro area, which would result in domestic demand that is too low, or adjusting the stance by less than would be optimal.  Today, fragmentation could result from the legacy effects of the pandemic, so we need a different mechanism for addressing it than during the financial crisis.{[}16{]} We have a framework that has served us well over the last two years, when the flexibility of our pandemic emergency purchase programme and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU instrument proved sufficient to stem fragmentation. This gives us a good indication of the direction we should now take. And we know from experience that the more credible a backstop is, the less likely it is to be used.

Faced with high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook with pitfalls on both sides, we should adjust policy carefully and recalibrate it as we see the effects of our decisions, so as to avoid suffocating the recovery and cement progress towards price stability.  That was already the case before the invasion of Ukraine, but this terrible event has made the need for prudence even greater. The world has become darker, and our steps should be smaller still.  At the ECB we stand by the people of Ukraine, who are now seeing what they hold dearest threatened by an unjustifiable act of aggression that violates the most fundamental principles of international law. That a country can be subjected to a full military invasion should steel our determination to defend those principles wherever we are, however we can.  The ECB’s role is clear: we will take any measures necessary, using all our instruments to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets. This is the duty of a central bank in times of emergency. And we will swiftly implement the sanctions decided on by the European Union. The scenes we have witnessed this past week will scar our memories forever. But I hope that, one day, we will look back on this moment and be proud that we did our duty, showed resolve and unity, and sought to uphold the universal values of peace, freedom and prosperity.

(2021a), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. The effect of higher energy prices is similar to that of a terms of trade tax that the euro area is paying to the rest of the world. See Panetta, F. (2021a), op. cit. Pre-crisis trends do not always represent the right benchmark for the recovery. The great financial crisis, for example, was created by excessive borrowing from the future which then had to be reabsorbed through a prolonged process of deleveraging. But the pandemic was a temporary exogenous shock which should not have significantly reduced the supply capacity of the economy. The pre-crisis growth path is therefore a reasonable standard.

For instance, Russia and Belarus produce large quantities of potash, Ukraine produces rare gases needed to produce lasers used in semi-conductor production, and Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of wheat. The ECB’s survey of large corporates paints a similar picture, foreseeing average wage increases to rise from around 2\\% in the recent past to 3\\% or more this year, although with significantly higher rates of wage growth in some sectors with labour shortages.

The average rate of negotiated wages growth was 1.5\\% in 2021 after 1.8\\% in 2020 as a whole, below our December projections. Consumers’ expectations, which arguably feed most directly into wage negotiations, show a distinct but temporary “hump” shape compared with January last year (the distribution in January 2022 shifts out for 1-year ahead expectations but shifts back in for 3-year ahead expectations, see Chart 13). Longer-term expectations are also becoming more concentrated around the 2\\% level compared with a year ago (Chart 14, left panel), while a growing number of monetary analysts see inflation stabilising at 2\\%, with only a small proportion seeing inflation above this target (Chart 14, right panel). Despite the surge in short-term inflation, recent research analysing the option-implied probabilities of tail events indicates that investors still fear the euro area may fall back into a deflationary trap in the future, whereas for the United States the opposite risk is higher. See Hilscher, J. Raviv Bar-Ilan, A. and Reis, R., (2022), How likely is an inflation disaster?, mimeo, London School of Economics, February. The paper also shows that in 2021 market perceptions of a high-inflation outcome rose significantly for the United States, but not for the euro area. These results (which estimate the tail probabilities for persistently very high or very low inflation using the prices of inflation options) reflect, among other things the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy regime. Brainard, W.C. (1967), —op. cit. In September 2020, for example, I made the argument that “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.” See Panetta, F. (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September. Söderström, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with Uncertain Parameters,” The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No 1, pp. 125-145. This fall is also visible in measures adjusted for risk premia at shorter horizons. In the United States and the United Kingdom measures of inflation expectations have remained broadly unchanged in recent weeks. In the past, the issue was resolved with an instrument – the Outright Monetary Transactions – designed for a situation where the main driver of fragmentation was unsound national policies, for which macroeconomic adjustment programmes were designed. & id\\_0001 & 2022-02-28\\\\\n",

This is a sad day for Europe and the world. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. In such times of extreme uncertainty, central banks need to be a source of confidence and a reliable anchor for the economy. Therefore, we are monitoring the situation closely. My remarks today reflect the macroeconomic situation predating the war. In the euro area, inflation has proven more persistent and more broad-based than expected, labour market slack is being reabsorbed at a faster pace than anticipated and pipeline pressures continue to build up. At the same time, prospects are rising that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may herald a turning point in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this environment, monetary policy needs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices today will not jeopardise price stability over the medium term. Households and firms count on the ECB to protect their purchasing power without putting at risk the current strong recovery from the crisis. Our policy framework enables us to deliver on these expectations. Our forward guidance has explicitly defined the conditions that need to be met for policy rates to be raised. And the clear sequence with which we intend to remove monetary stimulus, if and when necessary, reduces the uncertainty about how our actions will affect financing conditions and the broader economy. In the following, I will first discuss the current outlook for inflation. I will then explain the sequencing of policy measures that we will take once the Governing Council judges that policy should be normalised and will elaborate in more detail on three aspects that are more specific to the euro area. The first regards the question as to how the inflation outlook affects the policy normalisation process. The second point relates to how the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area affects the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. And the third point provides thoughts on how our sequence may interact with conditions in sovereign bond markets and the risks of fragmentation. A qualitative and quantitative change in the euro area’s inflation outlook A year ago, there was a widely shared expectation that inflation would rise sharply in response to the reopening of our economies but would subside swiftly as the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic would fade. There was a strong conviction that the combination of statistical base effects, slowing energy price inflation and the removal of one-off tax effects would mark a turning point in the euro area’s inflation trajectory towards the end of last year. These expectations have been disappointed. Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) continued to increase both in December 2021 and in January 2022, when it reached a new historical high of 5.1\\% (Slide 2). In January, euro area inflation surprised to the upside for the seventh consecutive month. Today, inflation is not only higher than expected, but price pressures are also visibly broadening. Measures of underlying inflation are following an unprecedented upward trend (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The prices of around two-thirds of the goods and services included in the HICP are currently increasing at an annual rate above 2\\% (Slide 3, right-hand chart). Less than a year ago, this share was close to 20\\%. Current measured inflation would be even higher if the costs of owner-occupied housing were included. Residential real estate prices continued to increase at an alarming pace. In the third quarter of 2021, prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 9\\% year-on-year, an unprecedented rate of increase (Slide 4, left-hand chart). If owner-occupied housing were included in the HICP, headline inflation in the third quarter of 2021 would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. For core inflation, the difference would have been twice as much – that is, core inflation would have been 2\\% rather than 1.4\\%, which is the largest difference observed since the start of the sample in 2012 (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Looking forward, the broad-based nature of recent upward surprises, extending well beyond the energy component, implies that significant uncertainty remains as to when the inflation peak will eventually be reached. What is becoming increasingly clear is that inflation is unlikely to fall back below our 2\\% target this year. It may increase even further over the near term before declining gradually over the course of 2022 as energy price inflation should slow. But the decline is not going to be nearly as fast as we previously anticipated. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2\\% target from above, rather than from below. The start of the year has seen three broad developments that corroborate this view. From pandemic to endemic? First, there are growing signs that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may bring forward the transition towards an endemic equilibrium. Although hospitalisations are still increasing in some countries alongside elevated case counts, admissions to intensive care units and fatality rates are now only a fraction of what they were in previous waves. There is a real chance that the Omicron variant could herald an inflection point after which the global community will be able to live with COVID-19 in spite of possible recurrent episodes of high case numbers. As governments worldwide are easing contact restrictions, the remaining slack in the economy will likely be reabsorbed at a faster pace than previously anticipated, in particular in contact-intensive services where the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on business and sentiment.  The most recent survey data corroborate this view for the euro area. In February, sentiment in the services sector improved sharply, back to levels seen before the discovery of the Omicron variant. A faster and more frontloaded recovery, in turn, risks increasing pressure on wages at a time when the labour market in the euro area is already showing first signs of strain. This brings me to the second point – the recovery in the labour market.  Strong recovery in the labour market Although the pandemic is still raging through the economy, slack in the labour market has continued to decline at a notably faster pace than projected (Slide 5, left-hand chart). A year ago, our central forecast was that the euro area unemployment rate would decline, on average, to 8.1\\% in 2022. In December 2021, the unemployment rate stood already at 7\\%. We are currently witnessing the strongest labour market in the history of the single currency. The unemployment rate is at a record low and below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), while the participation rate is at a record high (Slide 5, right-hand chart). Broader labour market slack, too, for which data are lagging, was already reabsorbed, by and large, by the end of the summer of last year, as strong demand is bringing more and more people – also those at the fringes of the labour market – back into work.{[}1{]}  While total hours worked still remained below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, there are good reasons to believe that the widespread easing of contact restrictions will help accelerate progress on that front too. Survey evidence confirms the picture of a tightening labour market. A rapidly rising share of firms across all economic sectors report shortages of labour as a factor limiting production. This is now the case for about a quarter to a third of all firms, a level never before observed in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand chart). Vacancy rates across the euro area are significantly higher than before the pandemic, which is consistent with firms reporting continued strong employment demand ahead (Slide 6, right-hand chart). These developments will add to pressure on wages as our economies continue to reopen. Although negotiated wage growth remains moderate, our latest corporate telephone survey among larger firms showed that wage pressures are expected to build up fast. Euro area firms anticipate considerably higher wage increases in the near term. For 2022, their average expected wage increase is 3.5\\%. The survey also showed that higher input costs, such as wages, are being passed through to consumer prices at a faster pace and to a larger extent than in the past, as strong pent-up demand creates a favourable environment for protecting or boosting profit margins. A faster pass-through, in turn, implies that for medium-term price pressures it is less relevant how fast wages expand today than how fast they will grow this year and next. Pipeline pressures remain elevated Third, pipeline pressures, which affect consumer price inflation with a lag, continue to build up. Import price inflation for intermediate and final consumer goods has increased further and remains at extraordinarily high levels (Slide 7, left-hand chart). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation reached a new all-time high in November. The inflation rate of services producer prices, which are an important element in the cost structure of both manufacturing and services firms, stands at 4.3\\%, which is almost nine times as high as its historical average. All services sectors report stronger price pressures than before the pandemic. These pipeline pressures will fade only gradually and will likely remain a source of upward pressure for consumer prices over the foreseeable future, with most firms expecting unusual cost pressures to persist for at least another six months. In addition, in large parts of the euro area the recent surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices will only be passed through to consumer prices with a lag. There is also a lot of uncertainty whether energy inflation will decline to the extent suggested by the futures curves underlying our December projections (Slide 7, right-hand chart). Brent oil spot prices are now at their highest levels since 2014 and current futures curves are well above the levels seen at the end of last year. Gas futures prices, too, are markedly higher than in December of last year. While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.{[}2{]}  In the EU, price developments under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) signal such an impending structural shift. ETS prices have recently reached a new record high of around €90 per tonne of carbon, almost three times as high as at the beginning of 2021, and they are expected to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. It is a reminder of the challenges we are facing in anticipating potential structural shifts in the underlying inflation process that could extend well beyond the energy sector.{[}3{]}  Sequencing of policy normalisation in the euro area All in all, there have been few instances in the recent past where the information set available to policymakers has changed so profoundly and in such a short period of time as has been the case since the beginning of the year. How today’s attack on Ukraine changes the euro area outlook is highly uncertain at this stage. We are monitoring the situation closely and will carefully evaluate the consequences for our policies. Based on the macroeconomic situation predating the war, however, inflationary pressures will likely prove stronger and more persistent over both the near and the medium term. Policy optionality is therefore needed more than ever to protect price stability.{[}4{]}  Our decisions in December of last year to end net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and to recalibrate the path of future purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) have been a first important step in this direction. At our next meeting in March, we will reassess whether the current path of asset purchases remains consistent with the updated inflation outlook, and we will thoroughly evaluate the progress made towards meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. While both the calibration and the time of adjustment of our policy instruments are data-dependent, the sequence with which we intend to adjust our policy stance is not. Our sequencing is subject to three guideposts. The first is our rate forward guidance, which provides the anchor for the normalisation process. It defines three conditions that need to be satisfied in the view of the Governing Council for our key policy rates to be raised: first, inflation reaching 2\\% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon; second, inflation remaining around 2\\% durably for the rest of the projection horizon; and, third, realised progress in underlying inflation being consistent with our inflation target. The second guidepost is that we will stop net asset purchases under the APP “shortly before” we increase our main policy rates. “Shortly before” is a term that is deliberately vague. It does not indicate a pre-defined distance between the end of our net asset purchases and policy rate lift-off. It does, however, imply that we will end net asset purchases under the APP once we judge that it is sufficiently likely that the rate forward guidance criteria are going to be fulfilled over the foreseeable future, while rates are going to be raised only when these conditions are actually met. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key policy rates. Again, the notion of an “extended period” is kept open to leave sufficient optionality in order to be able to respond to changes in the inflation outlook. In principle, this sequence is not very different from the one adapted by many other central banks, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. It defines a clear succession of steps that leaves sufficient flexibility to adjust the length of time needed before activating the next step of the sequence. That said, there are three considerations that are more specific to the euro area. Adjusting policy when inflation is converging to target The first relates to the inflation outlook. A central bank that faces a significant risk of inflation being markedly above target over the medium term would need to initiate a rapid sequence of policy rate hikes to above their estimated neutral levels. According to survey and market-based proxies, this would require bringing policy rates well into positive territory (Slide 8). However, these are not the conditions that we are facing today.  Rather, the economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2\\% target over the medium term. The current inflation outlook therefore calls for a gradual normalisation of our policy stance, reflecting the significant progress made towards meeting our inflation target in the future. During such a process of gradual normalisation, the focus should be first on unwinding step-by-step the exceptional measures we took to fight low inflation, starting with net asset purchases. The degree to which policy will need to be adjusted over time depends on how the inflation outlook continues to evolve. The focus on ending net asset purchases first reflects, at least in part, the fact that their side effects tend to increase over time.{[}5{]}  The experience of the past few years demonstrates, for example, that balance sheet policies have a significantly larger impact on house prices than changes in short-term policy rates, thereby contributing to the measurable rise in residential real estate prices (Slide 9).{[}6{]}  Similarly, years of balance sheet expansion have caused the bond free float in some economies to decline to very low levels (Slide 10, left-hand chart). As such, an end to net asset purchases enhances the availability of safe assets that the market requires to function well (Slide 10, right-hand chart).{[}7{]}  Ending net asset purchases when inflation is robustly converging to our target also credibly underlines that our actions are solely guided by our mandate, refuting concerns about fiscal dominance. Finally, in the current environment of large imported inflation, reversing the current exceptional measures has the potential to mitigate inflationary pressures even without the usual long lag in policy transmission. Over the past years, these measures have contributed to large capital outflows from the euro area, thereby putting downward pressure on the euro exchange rate (Slide 11). The exit from these measures can thus support the currency and, for a net importer of energy, provide tangible and immediate support to euro area households and firms by improving the terms of trade. Choice of policy instruments The second aspect relates to the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. This choice crucially depends on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The euro area remains a bank-based economy. Although market-based debt financing has gained importance since the global financial crisis, bank credit remains by far the dominant source of external finance for euro area firms (Slide 12, left-hand chart).{[}8{]}  The financing structure, in turn, has important implications for how strongly a given monetary impulse is transmitted to the real economy. Recent ECB staff analysis finds that when the share of bank loans in total external finance is high, like in the euro area, real GDP growth often shows only a weak response to changes in long-term interest rates (Slide 12, right-hand chart). In other words, our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process. Most of firms’ credit is either linked directly to short-term rates in financial markets, such as the EURIBOR, or has fixed maturities of short duration. Half of outstanding loans to euro area firms have a maturity of one year or less. Long-term rates are not only less relevant for policy transmission, central banks also have only indirect control over the part that is not related to the expected future path of short-term interest rates, i.e. the term premium.  The latter is affected by a host of factors, such as inflation uncertainty, global spillovers or demand by price-insensitive investors. The stock of bonds held by central banks is just one of these factors. Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance. This is also why our sequence foresees that policy lift-off will predate with some distance a reduction of our balance sheet. Risks of fragmentation This brings me to my third consideration – the question as to whether and how changes in sovereign bond market conditions could challenge our sequencing. Despite significant progress in recent years, the euro area’s institutional architecture remains incomplete. In the absence of a common fiscal capacity, and with public debt at elevated levels owing to the pandemic, parts of the euro area remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. There are three mitigating factors at present, however. One is that the combination of a long period of historically low rates and the marked increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt has measurably reduced the sensitivity of debt to changes in market interest rates. The average interest rate will remain low for some time even if the marginal interest rate starts rising (Slide 13, left-hand chart). Second, with average interest rates remaining low, and inflation receding only gradually, the strong expected recovery over the coming years should lead to a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios (Slide 13, right-hand chart). Structural reforms and large-scale investments related to Next Generation EU should foster confidence in the capacity of euro area countries to generate sustained high growth. Third, our decision in December last year to reinvest flexibly under the PEPP provides a strong mechanism to preserve the transmission of monetary policy in the event of severe and self-fulfilling market dislocations that would jeopardise the achievement of our mandate. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter renewed negative shocks related to the pandemic. Hence, we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation, while our monetary policy stance is guided by our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Conclusion Let me conclude. The inflation outlook has firmed since the start of the year. Inflationary pressures have broadened and have become more persistent. The expected easing of contact restrictions, together with the strong recovery in the labour market and elevated pipeline pressures have increased upside risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, the shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook. In this environment, we need to carefully reflect on how much monetary policy stimulus is required for inflation to stabilise at our target over the medium term, so as to neither fall below 2\\% once the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic fade, nor to allow an extended period of high inflation to become entrenched over time. This uncertainty speaks in favour of a gradual and data-dependent normalisation that respects the sequence that we have communicated, with a view to reducing uncertainty about our actions and intentions.

It is more than 30 years now since the first Anti-money Laundering Directive was published in June 1991. Since then, the framework has undergone many improvements, with the previous – fifth – AML Directive being published in May 2018.  The framework grew both in terms of the number and the forms of the regulatory instruments involved, incorporating both regulations and directives, as well as regulatory technical standards and guidelines developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Market Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. Nevertheless, the AML Directive has remained the core of the legal framework.  The ECB provided opinions on many of those legislative proposals. The ECB does not and cannot have any mandate to exercise anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. However, as my ECB Supervisory Board colleague Edouard Fernandez-Bollo aptly articulated in a recently published blog post: “Some things matter to you, even if you are not directly responsible for them.”  The EU AML/CFT framework affects the ECB’s tasks relating to the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the tasks that fall within its central banking mandate.  In particular, it is important for the ECB to factor the outcomes of AML/CFT supervision into its prudential supervisory processes. The risk of the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing is relevant for ECB prudential supervisory decisions on acquisitions of qualifying holdings in supervised entities, granting and withdrawing authorisations to credit institutions, and suitability assessments of existing or prospective managers of supervised entities. The outcomes of AML/CFT supervision are also reflected in day-to-day supervision as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.  Since the exchange of confidential information between the ECB and the AML/CFT supervisors was enabled in 2018 by an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, the ECB, as a prudential supervisor, has concluded an agreement on information exchange with more than 50 AML/CFT supervisory authorities across all Members States of the European Economic Area. This cooperation was further enhanced by subsequent amendments to the Directive in 2019, as well as by the establishment of AML/CFT colleges, in which the ECB participates as an observer. Over the past years the ECB has also been actively contributing to the work of the EBA’s AML Standing Committee. Good and efficient cooperation with AML/CFT supervisory authorities is therefore an important priority for us. Last year, following discussions in the Council of the EU, the Commission presented a set of legislative proposals for major changes to the EU AML/CFT framework: The first substantial change consists in transforming most of the requirements addressed to private entities from the AML Directive to a directly applicable EU regulation.  The second, and even more fundamental change is the establishment of a new authority at the EU level with a mandate for both direct and indirect AML/CFT supervision across all EU Member States. We see this as an important shift which has the potential to bring a more harmonised application of EU AML/CFT requirements and convergence of practices in AML/CFT supervision across the EU.  The third and most prominent change, which concerns the ECB’s central banking activities, is the introduction of an EU-wide limit to payments in cash. This type of measure has so far only been implemented at the level of individual Member States by means of national legislation. In the past the ECB has opined on a number of such national legislative measures. The legislative package published by the Commission consists of four legislative acts. The ECB was consulted on most elements of the legislative package by the European Parliament and the Council in October 2021. The ECB Governing Council recently adopted and published its opinions on all four elements of the package. My colleagues will give more details on the main themes which the ECB opinions touch upon. Most of the observations and suggestions in the ECB opinions seek to improve the framework of cooperation and information exchange with the future AML Authority, as well as the national AML/CFT authorities.  The ECB incorporated in its opinions its experience from establishing EU-level prudential supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, to the extent that it could be useful in establishing the EU-level AML/CFT supervision. I would like to highlight that the criteria for identifying the selected entities that will be under the direct supervision of the future AML Authority are relatively strict. The Commission envisages that only between 12 and 20 obliged entities will meet these criteria. Based on its experience, the ECB would strongly support amending these criteria such that a wider pool of obliged entities would be directly supervised by the AML Authority, including entities headquartered in each Member State. This would promote a common supervisory culture and convergence of AML/CFT supervisory practices.  Also, considering the strict, risk-based nature of the selection criteria, the publication of the list of selected obliged entities would be tantamount to indirectly disclosing the high money laundering risk status of selected supervised entities, sending unintended signals to the markets or creating reputational issues for selected obliged entities directly supervised by the new AML authority.  The most prominent element of the ECB opinions is the analysis of the proposed limit to cash payments.

And thank you to the Chair of the panel for allowing me to open the discussion with some remarks on the importance of transition planning. I fully appreciate the irony of what I’m about to say, what with you in Paris and me here on-screen, but we are all on the path to Paris. Citizens, firms, banks and prudential supervisors alike are working towards the climate goals agreed in 2015 as the EU and national governments roll out policies implementing the Paris Agreement.  In previous speeches, I have stressed the need for banks to put in place transition plans compatible with EU policies implementing the Paris Agreement – plans with concrete intermediate milestones to enhance banks’ long-term strategies and decision-making. More and more banks are already doing this themselves, while the European Commission also called for enhanced transition planning in its sustainable finance strategy published in July 2021.  For ECB Banking Supervision, the main concern that needs to be addressed by these transition plans is the level of banks’ risk exposures and the effectiveness of their controls. Have the exposures been sufficiently mitigated and are they prudent? As climate-related and environmental risks become increasingly widespread and more material, banks will, inevitably, be exposed to them, through both physical and transition risks. Banks therefore need adequate risk mitigation measures in place. This is what we need to assess as the prudential supervisor.  Introducing a legal requirement for banks to have a clear, detailed and prudent transition plan in place would increase the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory framework and contribute to maintaining a level playing field. Needless to say, we are very happy to see that this is exactly what the European Commission has proposed in its review of the Capital Requirements Directive, which is now with the co-legislators.  But it doesn’t stop there. For banks to be able to manage their transition risks adequately, they need to have information on how their customers are performing relative to a Paris-aligned transition path. This is where the European Commission’s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive comes in. The ECB welcomed this proposed directive in a legal opinion and it is now awaiting approval by the co-legislators.  The current standards on sustainability disclosure are insufficient to ensure that sustainability-related financial risks are properly understood and priced by market participants. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is a necessary step to address the gaps that currently hinder the development of appropriate sustainability policy, risk assessment and risk monitoring frameworks for the financial sector. This is because it will not only explicitly ask large banks to disclose their transition plans, it will also ask banks’ corporate clients to do the same. This last point is crucial, as it will enable banks to assess the climate-related and environmental risks in their asset portfolios. These disclosures are therefore an important element in ensuring that banks manage all material risks, in line with what we as the prudential supervisor expect them to do.  The climate-and-environmental puzzle is still highly complicated, but we can now see the pieces slotting into place. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the elements included in the Commission’s proposals are implemented in actual binding legislation entering into force without undue delay. This will smooth the path to Paris for all.

Throughout history, money and payments have been constantly evolving. And this also holds true in the digital age. As we increasingly pay digitally and shop online, we rely less on cash. Our wallets are gradually moving from our pockets to smartphones and other electronic devices.  These changes have profound implications for the nature of money itself, raising the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies for retail use.  Today I will argue that in a digital world CBDCs are necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilising force at the heart of the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty.  But CBDCs will need to be carefully designed. To be successful, they will need to add value for users, support competition rather than crowd out private innovation, and avoid risks to financial intermediation.  Why we need central bank digital money Our monetary system is based on the complementarity of private money with public money – which is available for retail payments in the form of banknotes.{[}1{]}  Confidence in private means of payment is determined by our ability to convert private money into safe public money. This is because central bank money is a risk-free form of money that is guaranteed by the State: by its strength, its credibility, its authority.  Other types of money are liabilities of private issuers: their value is based on the soundness of the issuer and is underpinned by the promise of one-to-one convertibility with central bank money.{[}2{]} Our readiness to hold private money such as bank deposits reflects the confidence that we can always go to a branch or a cash machine and convert our deposits into cash. The fact that we can do this tells us that our deposits are safe. It reassures us that we will be able to convert them into risk-free central bank money in the future, too.  Bank runs and financial crises start when confidence in the convertibility of private money evaporates.{[}3{]} Without the anchor of sovereign money, people would constantly have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money. This would undermine confidence in the singleness of money and impair the functioning of the payments system.{[}4{]}  History provides examples for this. In times when various forms of private money coexisted in the absence of sovereign money – such as the free banking era of the 19th century – the notes issued by banks often traded at variable prices{[}5{]} and instability risks{[}6{]} required dominant banks and clearinghouses to act as quasi-central banks{[}7{]}. The consensus among central banks on the coexistence between public and private money was summarised 20 years ago as follows: “The composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency. In other words, central banks would accept neither an outcome in which central bank money crowds out private initiative, nor an outcome in which central bank money is phased out by a market mechanism.”{[}8{]}  In the digital age, however, banknotes could lose their role as a reference value in payments, undermining the integrity of the monetary system.{[}9{]} Central banks must therefore consider how to ensure that their money can remain a payments anchor in a digital world.  Some have suggested that innovative private payment solutions such as stablecoins could, if properly regulated, make CBDCs superfluous.{[}10{]} However, confidence in stablecoins would also depend on the ability to convert them into central bank money,{[}11{]} unless stablecoin issuers were allowed to invest the reserve assets in risk-free deposits at the central bank. But this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money, which would endanger monetary sovereignty.{[}12{]} Moreover, in the absence of public money, stablecoins could exacerbate the “winner-takes-all” dynamics inherent in payment markets, with adverse consequences for the functioning of the payments system.{[}13{]} And stablecoins’ potentially large investments in safe assets could affect the availability of these assets.{[}14{]} This could in turn have an impact on market functioning and real interest rates, with undesirable implications from a monetary policy perspective.{[}15{]}  Other threats to monetary sovereignty could emerge in the absence of a domestic digital currency. If a foreign CBDC were to be widely adopted, this could lead to digital currency substitution{[}16{]}. This risk would be higher for small countries with unstable currencies and weak fundamentals, especially if the CBDC were issued in a major economy.{[}17{]} But it could eventually also affect leading currencies.{[}18{]}  Such risks are not imminent, but they should not be underestimated. Just as the US dollar overtook the pound sterling as the leading reserve currency within only a decade of the end of the First World War,{[}19{]} digital innovation may give rise to powerful new foreign contenders, with disruptive consequences for those markets that are not prepared to face the digital challenge.  The widespread adoption of a foreign CBDC would increase the risk of financial transactions being based on technologies managed and supervised elsewhere, with limited oversight by domestic authorities. A system of this kind may not have sufficient safeguards against external threats, including cyber threats. It could put the confidential data of people, businesses, and states at greater risk of being misused. And it could make the information needed to counter criminal activities harder to trace.  The scenario I am describing is not one of science fiction. It is already the case in the market for crypto-assets, which are widely used for criminal activities.{[}20{]} A similar situation might affect other digital asset markets in the future. So the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted, and this will make a big difference.{[}21{]} But it may not be sufficient.  The main benefits of CBDCs  A CBDC would preserve the coexistence of sovereign and private money in a digital world. This is not an abstract benefit – it is the basis for financial and monetary stability, ensuring competition and efficiency in payment markets. But a CBDC could generate even more benefits for users.  It could improve the confidentiality of digital payments. The information contained in electronic transactions can be monetised by private companies{[}22{]}, posing a threat to privacy. This risk is further compounded by big techs starting to offer financial services and by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Data protection regulation aims to prevent misuse, but cannot always keep pace with technological innovation, as we have seen in past cases of data breaches and misuse by tech companies.{[}23{]}  If a digital currency were offered by an independent public institution such as the central bank – which has no interest in exploiting individual payment data for any purpose – it could enhance, not reduce, the confidentiality of electronic payments. Potential users clearly want this: when we consulted the public on the topic, privacy was identified as the most important aspect of a digital euro.{[}24{]} Sound governance arrangements that comply with data protection regulations would ensure that payment information is only accessed for permitted purposes, such as countering illegal activities. We are cooperating with the relevant European authorities on this issue.  A digital euro would also increase choice and reduce costs, contributing to a level playing field in payments.{[}25{]} Key segments of the euro area payments market, such as cards and e-payments, are dominated by a handful of players, which strengthens their pricing power. Some estimates suggest that Europeans pay about 1.4\\% of GDP for payments services. In the United States, the costs are higher.{[}26{]}  One might argue that private service providers are already well equipped to offer low-cost digital payment solutions. However, the limited evidence available suggests that low-income households use digital payments less than high-income households. This is consistent with the hypothesis that digital payments remain expensive for many users.{[}27{]} And even in advanced financial systems, many citizens are “unbanked” or “underbanked”.{[}28{]} Although financial inclusion depends on several factors, such as financial and digital literacy, the cost of financial services is likely to play a role.  Our digital euro project comes with a commitment that all – including vulnerable population groups – will have access to safe public money in the digital era.  Designing a successful digital euro  The fact that CBDCs are necessary to guarantee the smooth functioning of the payments market does not mean that their success should be taken for granted. Users may lack incentives to fully appreciate such benefit and – given the vast supply of private digital monies – could show limited interest in CBDCs. Indeed, we face two opposite risks: being “too successful” and crowding out private payment solutions and financial intermediation, or being “not successful enough” and generating insufficient demand. We take both risks seriously.  To avoid interfering with the functioning of the financial system, we are considering how to make the digital euro a convenient medium of exchange but not an attractive form of investment. We are examining the pros and cons of introducing a quantitative cap on digital euro holdings{[}29{]} or a tiered remuneration that would disincentivise excessive holdings.{[}30{]} We are analysing the potential impact on monetary policy. To ensure that our digital currency would be a convenient means of payment, we are working to make it available within private payment solutions, so that people would be able to use it easily wherever they can pay digitally. We aim to level the playing field by allowing intermediaries – including small ones – to offer innovative solutions to their customers. And we are considering how a digital euro could improve financial inclusion. We are interviewing focus groups to identify the characteristics of a digital euro that would add value for users. And we are working on the technical options to reconcile different objectives such as the right of individuals to confidentiality versus the public interest in guaranteeing the transparency required to counter illegal activities; or the benefits of allowing the digital euro to be widely used versus the need to safeguard financial intermediation.  We have launched several work streams: on the design choices that can guarantee confidentiality, on the prioritisation of different use cases,{[}31{]} and on the business options for intermediaries{[}32{]}. We will cover areas such as cyber security and operational resilience.  We are interacting with all relevant stakeholders, from intermediaries to consumers, merchants and authorities. We are cooperating with the European Parliament, the European Commission and the finance ministers of the euro area countries. To get technical advice and collect a broad range of views on possible solutions, we have set up a Market Advisory Group{[}33{]} and are regularly discussing the project with the Euro Retail Payments Board{[}34{]}, academics and think tanks. Bearing in mind the international implications of CBDCs,{[}35{]} we are cooperating with other major central banks. In October 2021 we launched a two-year investigation phase to define the design features of the digital currency. At the end of 2023 we could decide to start a realisation phase to develop and test the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro, which could take three years. Only thereafter will we decide whether to actually issue a digital euro.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  For decades, the complementarity of public money and private money has guaranteed stability, competition and innovation.  The digitalisation of payments cannot be ignored by central banks, which have so far provided their money only in physical form. Central banks cannot escape these transformations, nor should they underestimate the potential for far-reaching shifts that may occur.  To ensure that public money maintains its fundamental role in the digital age, the ECB has launched an investigation into the possible issuance of a digital euro alongside cash.  The digital euro is an ambitious and complex project that can improve the efficiency of the economic and financial system. We want to make it a driver of stability and inclusive progress, capable of strengthening ties between economies and financial systems around the world. Our experience may provide useful insights for other central banks. And likewise, we are keen to learn from them. I am therefore pleased to exchange views with US experts, and I am now looking forward to our discussion.    Although central bank money can also take the form of reserves (deposits that commercial banks hold at the central bank), the focus of this speech will be on cash. One-to-one convertibility with central bank money is what makes the regulated forms of money convertible with each other and is why they are perceived as interchangeable when making payments. This does not mean that the safeguards put in place to protect savings – legislation and banking supervision, deposit insurance schemes, capital markets supervision – are not important. On the contrary. They must, however, be flanked by convertibility to ensure the smooth functioning of payments and the stability of the financial system. On the singleness of money see Bank for International Settlements (2003),  The role of central bank money in payment systems , Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, August. For instance, the notes of new banks were more heavily discounted. See Gorton, G. (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No 2, pp. 346-397. Price variability was inconvenient, as users had to consult a note reporter to monitor the value of the notes in circulation. See Eichengreen, B. (2019), “From Commodity to Fiat and Now to Crypto: What Does History Tell Us?”, NBER Working Paper Series, No 25426, January. The experience of the free banking era in the United States varied considerably among states and each had a significant number of problem banks. See Rolnick, A.J. and Weber, W.E. (1983), “New Evidence on the Free Banking Era”, American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No 5, pp. 1080-1091. In the United States, dominant banks disciplined note issuing banks by threatening them with bulk redemption of their notes, while clearinghouses regulated member bank levels of equity, reserves, and interest rates, audited members, produced money during crises and issued a form of insurance; See Gorton, G. (1985), “Banking theory and free banking history: A Review Essay”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 16(2), 267-276. See Bank for International Settlements (2003), op. cit. For an overview of the role of central bank money over the past 20 years, see Bindseil, U., and Terol, I (2020), “The evolving role of central bank money in payments”, Central Banking, 15 July. While banks could continue to hold central bank money in the form of reserves, this may not prove sufficient to fully preserve the monetary anchor role of central bank money. People would be unable to use central bank money as means of exchange and would thus have little incentive to hold it. This would weaken the unit of account role of sovereign money. If the currency is not demanded by the public, the mere announcement that the central bank would make it available would not be enough to preserve its role in the economy. In history, sovereign money was at times used as unit of account but not as a medium of exchange. This was for example the case of the livre, the “imaginary money” introduced by Charlemagne in the monetary reform of the eighth century, named after the libra (pound), the sovereign money introduced by the ancient King of Rome Servius Tullius in the sixth century BC. The livre was never coined and never circulated. However, it had a fixed conversion rate with another form of sovereign money, the denier (1 livre was equal to 240 deniers), which was actually coined and actively used as means of exchange.

(2021), “Parachute Pants and Central Bank Money”, speech at the 113th Annual Utah Bankers Association Convention, Sun Valley, Idaho, June.  The value of a stablecoin is linked to a portfolio of one or more other assets (the reserve assets), including currency in the form of commercial bank deposits. Stablecoins can therefore be low-risk but not risk-free. Risks increase if stablecoin arrangements are backed by risky or opaque assets, especially in times of market turmoil.

New players, including operating platforms with huge customer bases, can exploit network effects and economies of scale to build dominant positions, creating their own closed-loop ecosystems. They may exploit customer data for private scoring and other uses. They may erect barriers to impede interoperability and use their “coins” to displace other forms of money.

While the international role of a currency will continue to depend to a large extent on the fundamentals of the underlying economy, availability in CBDC form would facilitate use in cross-border payments by reducing frictions and costs. Model simulations suggest that the share of a country’s currency in global export payments increases when it is available as a CBDC, but continues to depend to a large extent on forces such as the size and the stability of the economy and the development and efficiency of the financial sector.

The European Union is revising the regulation, supervision and oversight of digital finance with the proposed Regulation of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and the ECB’s new payment oversight framework (PISA).

Beyond the well-known case of Oxford Analytica, big tech firms are facing increased criticism over revelations that staff and contractors listened to audio recordings of people speaking to virtual assistants, and voice chats recorded on messenger apps. Even children were affected: one major video-sharing app popular among young people was heavily fined in 2019 by the US Federal Trade Commission for collecting personal data from children under 13.

In the public consultation conducted by the ECB in 2020, 43\\% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of a digital euro, well ahead of other features. The other characteristics highlighted in the consultation were the security of payments and usability throughout the euro area, which were ranked first by 18\\% and 11\\% of those surveyed, respectively.

See McKinsey (2020),  The 2020 McKinsey Global Payments Report.  Based on the Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE), the preference for cash in the euro area is significantly higher among low-income respondents. While only 36\\% of those with an income of €1,000 per month or less have a preference for cards or other cashless means of payment, that preference was expressed by 61\\% in the income bracket of €2,500 and more. See Panetta, F. (2021), “Cash still king in times of COVID-19”, speech at the Deutsche Bundesbank’s 5th International Cash Conference on “Cash in times of turmoil”, 15 June. Although they are often invisible to the customer, the various layers of merchant fees can add up to some 3\\% of the transaction value. According to Glory Global Solutions, “Some banks tell merchants to budget for between 2.5\\% and 3\\% of the transaction valuable, but with so many variables, this is only ever a rough guide.” See Glory Global Solutions (2018),  Electronic Payments – Not As Cheap As You Think . In the United States, 6\\% of adults do not have a checking, savings, or money market account. See Federal Reserve (2019),  Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2018 - May 2019 . In the euro area there are still more than 5\\% of adults without a payment account. See World Bank (2017),  Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database  .  In the case of quantitative holding limits, we are considering waterfall solutions linking digital euro accounts to private money accounts, to allow payments in excess of the limit. Bindseil, U.

Use cases refer to the various interactions between people, businesses, Government and machines (e.g. payments at the point of sale, online, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, etc.). Business options are naturally related to costs (fees, devices), but can also include the front end, taking into account consumers’ preference to use the current payment methods, be it their smartphone, card or cash. A digital euro should provide a similar payment experience, while also considering future innovations like QR codes, which are becoming more and more popular.

Our focus today is the current state of C\\&E risk management practices in the banking sector, and the ECB’s upcoming thematic review of these risks. Over the last couple of years, we have launched several targeted actions in this direction. In 2020 we issued the ECB guide on C\\&E risks and in 2021 we conducted a supervisory review of banks’ approaches to managing these risks based on their own assessments. The ECB has progressively taken C\\&E risks into greater account in its supervision, as have banks in their business.  2022 will be the year that C\\&E risks become integrated in the day-to-day activities of our joint supervisory teams, who are in constant contact with banks. These risks will come to form an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with supervised entities and the supervisory review and evaluation process, the SREP. This will ultimately influence banks’ minimum capital requirements. The encompassing and integrated approach – which supervisors and banks are already very familiar with for traditional risk categories – is what I call the immersive supervisory approach to C\\&E risks. Along with the 2022 ECB supervisory stress test, the thematic review forms part of the ECB Banking Supervision roadmap to ensure that banks adequately incorporate C\\&E risk management. These supervisory activities complement the ECB’s broader C\\&E agenda, which includes publishing the results of an economy-wide climate change stress test, and our 2021 action plan to include climate change considerations in our monetary policy. The state of C\\&E risk management  Climate and environmental risks are impossible to avoid. The public knows it and the ECB knows it. The banks themselves now know it, as reflected in the outcome of their internal assessments. All banks that thoroughly assessed their exposure to C\\&E risks concluded that these risks are material. By contrast, not a single materiality assessment submitted by banks that reported no material risk exposure was deemed adequate. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the banks that acknowledged the materiality of the C\\&E risks they faced did so for both transition and physical risks. And they acknowledged that these risks are material in both the short and the long term. Despite this broad acknowledgement of the materiality of these risks, and thus the need to adequately manage them, we see that most banks still have a considerable way to go in developing their risk management capabilities. As the findings we published last year show, banks reported that 90\\% of their practices are only partially or not at all in line with ECB supervisory expectations. Let me repeat: 90\\%. This is both bad news and good news. Bad news because, at the time of their assessment, banks were a long way away from where they needed to be. But good news because half the banks we supervise already acknowledge that climate risks are an inevitable part of their day-to-day business. We therefore expect banks to analyse how C\\&E risks can or will affect their portfolios and products over the short, medium and long term, and under various scenarios, too. This type of forward-looking analysis of C\\&E risk should be basic practice, just as it would be for any other type of risk. Moreover, beyond merely formally attributing responsibilities, we still see banks making little progress towards more actively managing the C\\&E risks they face. Even certain banks that recognise the materiality of C\\&E risks have not reported any practices to either reduce or manage their level of risk. This year we want to see firm progress in how banks incorporate C\\&E risks in their risk management. In doing so, banks should adopt a strategic approach to managing these risks, using the full array of the risk management instruments at their disposal. This includes strategically realigning portfolios, setting clear risk appetites, developing mitigation strategies, adjusting qualitative credit criteria and quantifying and holding capital. Another key area in which banks can make progress is by actively supporting their clients in mitigating and adapting to the different types of climate and environmental risks. Moreover, banks can draw on the industry’s good practices that we shared last year in our report. In the face of data challenges and methodological uncertainties, banks have an even stronger imperative to get moving. To be clear, banks should not misconstrue the ECB’s actions as an outright call for divesting from carbon-intensive activities or from geographical regions vulnerable to physical risk. Rather, we are asking banks to fully grasp the physical and transition risks and to actively start managing them, with the aim of making their portfolios more resilient to C\\&E risks. Not all sectors will decarbonise overnight. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios show that certain sectors will continue to rely on carbon-intensive technologies for some time. We as prudential supervisors merely need banks to understand what the transition entails for their risk exposures to those sectors, and to reflect it in their overall risk management strategy. What we do not expect is an outright withdrawal from carbon-intensive industries, nor do we expect it to happen for every single sector or counterparty – but we do expect banks to harbour the capacity to manage the risks emerging from climate change. To draw a comparison with traditional risk exposures, we, as supervisors, would of course not expect banks to divest from all assets that entail credit risks, but we do insist that these risks are managed appropriately. C\\&E risks are to be managed just like any other risk; and their sound management requires sound risk controls. This is precisely one of our focus areas in the upcoming thematic review on C\\&E risks. Supervisory roadmap for C\\&E risks For several years, the ECB has identified banks’ exposure to C\\&E risks as one of the main vulnerabilities in the European banking sector. Assessing and helping banks address risks stemming from climate change and environmental degradation will be one of our supervisory priorities from now until 2024, albeit these risks have been on our minds for far longer. I remember giving my first speeches on this topic in late 2015 when still an executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank. So, we have already come a long way and our supervision of C\\&E risks will now take more concrete form. The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C\\&E risks.  The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C\\&E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the banks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front.  The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C\\&E risks, which is a key topic of the session today. Two years after we launched the supervisory guide on C\\&E risks, we are conducting this thematic review to follow up on the self-assessment exercise conducted last year. Our main goal will be to assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks’ C\\&E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C\\&E risk strategies and risk profiles. Do all banks’ processes and analyses have visible consequences? Does the way in which banks actually steer their balance sheets and risk profiles reflect the materiality of C\\&E risks? These will be some of the core questions of this review.  As part of this exercise, we will monitor banks’ alignment with the supervisory expectations set out in the guide, and encourage banks’ progress towards the industry’s best practices. Fortunately, those practices were identified across different European banks over the last two years. They show that some banks are already doing what we are asking. The ECB is doing its part by guiding banks in their climate journey, setting forth supervisory expectations and sharing updates on good practices in the industry. In light of the efforts banks have already made in devising their action plans, as well as all the information on this topic published to date – by both the ECB and several other public and private organisations we expect to see material progress in banks’ implementation deadlines and concrete actions.  As part of the thematic review, we will also be looking more closely at the risk management practices for environmental risks such as risks to biodiversity, water stress and pollution. All have similar features and warrant a coordinated approach. Banks can make significant savings if, taking advantage of the momentum, they extend the range of their preparations to cover all these risks, and are thus ready for a new, more concrete, supervisory and regulatory environment. Our benchmark from last year shows that, as of early 2021, very few banks were looking into environmental risks beyond climate. We have highlighted this gap to banks. This year, we will assess how banks are managing their exposures to environmental risks beyond climate and follow up accordingly.  As we build our joint supervisory teams’ capacity to help banks understand and incorporate C\\&E risks, our supervisors will treat these risks just like any other. Last year’s review was conducted by a central team of experts, with the joint supervisory teams conducting the follow-up dialogue with the bank. By contrast, this thematic review will be fully embedded in the work of every joint supervisory team. While still backed by a central team of experts, the review will be driven from the engine room of supervision. And this is where the supervision of C\\&E risks will stay. Following up on the thematic review, all banks under our direct supervision will receive comprehensive feedback setting out any shortcomings identified. Combined with the observations from the climate stress test, this will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. Targeted qualitative requirements may also be imposed. As part of the review, we will also carefully check whether banks have followed up on any requirements we issued last year. The thematic review is a full-on supervisory review. As such, we also have the full set of supervisory measures at our disposal to address shortcomings. Those banks that continue to fail to conduct a materiality assessment of C\\&E risks or have not followed-up on earlier requirements will start noticing just that. Regulatory and supervisory framework  The ECB is taking action under its mandate and under the current prudential framework to get banks to where they need to be in terms of incorporating C\\&E risks into their business. Our supervisory activities are thus keeping in line with the rapidly evolving regulatory and supervisory framework.  For example, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive proposed by the European Commission will further articulate the integration of C\\&E risks in the legal framework and will require banks to develop transition plans and supervisors to scrutinise them. This is the next important step in risk management, which I have mentioned on previous occasions, and which will require banks to look thirty years ahead and devise intermediate targets for their risk exposures that can render their risk management practices fit for an economy that will transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.  And finally, disclosure frameworks and taxonomies are also developing rapidly to create an information architecture to enable banks to manage the risks and scale up green finance. Both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have intensive work programmes to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework can better cater for climate-related risks. One concrete example is the EBA’s recently published implementing technical standards for the disclosure of Environmental Social and Governance risks, which also require large banks to start disclosing their alignment with the IEA pathways by June 2024 at the latest for all relevant portfolios. Banks are running out of time to complete their preparations. On all these fronts, the sooner banks act, the smoother the transition will be for them, and for the economy they help support.  Conclusion  For ECB Banking Supervision, 2022 marks the third year of dedicated C\\&E risk activities. First, we issued our guide with supervisory expectations. Next, we asked banks to share with us their self-assessments on how their practices match our expectations. And they have indeed been very open and candid in these self-assessments, for which I am truly grateful.  Together we have learnt that there is a lot of room for improvement. Considering the importance, urgency and long-lasting nature of climate change, we are asking banks to intensify their efforts in measuring and managing C\\&E risks in line with our expectations. With the exercises that we are conducting this year, the prudential supervision of climate-related risks is moving closer to maturity. The thematic review is the next step in fully immersing C\\&E risks in the work of the joint supervisory teams and marks key progress towards their integration in the SREP. It crystalises our commitment to ensuring that the prudential supervision of C\\&E risks is here to stay.

Across advanced economies, the current inflation spike is proving to be broader and more persistent than initially expected, leading central banks to reassess the risk that it could become entrenched. This is no easy task, especially in the euro area.  Economic conditions in the euro area have benefited from the strong response of monetary policy and its positive interactions with fiscal policy during the pandemic. But this is not a typical business cycle, and we are not seeing a typical recovery.  The current inflation spike is for the most part not being driven by domestic factors – by an economy that is “running hot”, in other words. Demand remains below its pre-crisis trend.  Instead, the economy is experiencing a series of imported supply shocks that are pushing up inflation and depressing demand. The exit from the pandemic is characterised by global mismatches between demand and supply – in energy and goods markets in particular – with uneven effects across sectors.  As a result, past economic regularities may be a poor guide for the future.  This makes medium-term developments extremely hard to anticipate. There are forces at play that could delay the recovery and contain underlying price pressures, and others that could lead to accelerating inflation. Policy mistakes in either direction could push the economy onto an unfavourable path.  Faced with such uncertainty, there is a case for the central bank to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps in adjusting policy, so as not to suffocate the as yet incomplete recovery.  If we are to durably escape the low inflation and low growth environment that has defined the past decade, we cannot afford to waste the progress we have made so far. In the spirit of William Brainard[1], we should take small steps in a dark room. The dramatic conflict in Ukraine is now weighing negatively on both supply and demand conditions, making uncertainty more acute and exacerbating risks to the medium-term inflation outlook on both sides. In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer. And the ECB stands ready to act to avoid any dislocation in financial markets that could stem from the war in Ukraine and to protect the transmission of monetary policy.  Inflation as an imported phenomenon The recent inflation data in the euro area do not make for easy reading. Headline inflation reached 5% in January and is expected to stay above 2% for the entire year, while core inflation is at 2.3%. Inflation pressures are becoming widespread (Chart 1).[2]  To determine how monetary policy should respond, we need to understand the drivers of this inflation spike. I have previously spoken about “good”, “bad” and “ugly” inflation in this context, and each of these has different implications for policy.[3]  In short, good inflation is driven by domestic demand and wages consistent with our target, which monetary policy should seek to nurture until that target is reached. Bad inflation instead reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices and depress economic activity, which monetary policy should look through. Ugly inflation – the worst type of inflation – is driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which monetary policy should immediately stamp out. Data indicate that bad inflation is still dominating in the euro area today.  Unlike in the United States, our economy is not experiencing excess domestic demand. Household nominal income has not recovered its pre-pandemic trend and households are saving more of their income than they did before the pandemic (Chart 2). Consumer spending and investment both remain well below their pre-crisis trends (Chart 3). Inflation is largely imported, reflecting global shocks to supply and demand that are spilling over to our economy through import prices (Chart 4, left panel).  Around 60% of inflation in January was energy, of which the euro area is a net importer (Chart 4, right panel). This is the consequence of the recent extraordinary increases in oil and gas prices (Chart 5, left panel). These in turn mainly reflect shocks that compress energy supply, rather than stronger aggregate demand (Chart 5, right panel). The rise in the cost of energy has further accelerated after the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Inflation is also being fuelled by the global shift in consumer spending from services to manufactured goods at a time when the pandemic has disrupted production. This has translated into global supply chain bottlenecks, high durable goods prices and strong pipeline pressures. This effect, which also represents a supply shock for the euro area, is now being reabsorbed, but at a different pace in different economies (Chart 6).  These global supply-driven increases in prices – above all energy and industrial goods, but also food – explain a good part of the currently high headline inflation (Chart 7, left panel).  In contrast, services inflation – the most domestic inflation component – has so far largely come from high-contact sectors (Chart 7, right panel). These sectors are experiencing frictions created by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and some of them (such as transport services) are also sensitive to energy prices.

Uncertainty in the inflation outlook Imported supply shocks that underpin bad inflation increase the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook in two main ways.  First, energy-driven inflation acts as a “tax”[4] on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. This adds to the uncertainty around the growth outlook, making it harder to judge when the economy is likely to reach full capacity. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was seeing a bounceback after the slowdown created by the Omicron wave. But we were still some way short of returning to our pre-crisis GDP trend, across a range of possible estimates (Chart 8). In my view, GDP reaching the bottom end of this range would be the bare minimum needed to conclude that resources are fully utilised[5] – and current projections suggest that this will not happen until the middle of 2023.  The terms of trade tax from higher energy prices could further delay the return to that growth path. The heavier energy bill has already reduced household purchasing power by around 2% (Chart 9, left panel) and is negatively affecting consumer confidence (Chart 9, right panel). It is also eroding the financial buffers built up during the pandemic, especially for households with low incomes, reducing the degree to which dissaving can support consumption in the future (Chart 10). Second, prolonged imported price shocks make it harder to assess whether inflation is feeding into domestic price pressures. The fact that core inflation is increasing above 2% may initially seem to suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are accumulating. However, rising core inflation is partly due to higher energy prices, which are pushing up costs in almost all sectors (Chart 11). Similarly, industrial goods inflation may remain elevated in the near term due to higher input costs, but beyond that its dynamics are hard to predict. Inventory levels are starting to return to normal, which suggests that demand might have peaked. The memory of supply shortages might prompt firms to build precautionary stocks that initially prolong tensions but ultimately lead to excess inventories once bottlenecks ease. This would amplify the manufacturing cycle and the volatility of goods inflation.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now intensifying this uncertainty.  We face greater financial volatility in the short term. There is a risk of renewed market dislocations as investors anticipate the potential impact of sanctions and possible retaliatory actions. And these dislocations might be felt unevenly, threatening the smooth transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. But we also face greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the medium term. The higher energy prices triggered by the conflict in Ukraine point to a longer period of above-target inflation, while supply disruptions of raw materials and food could prove more persistent[6]. At the same time, these factors increase the terms of trade tax and depress economic confidence, aggravating downside risks to growth and further delaying the return to full capacity.

Chart 9 Impact of “bad” inflation on demand    Sources: Left panel: ECB and ECB staff calculations; right panel: European Commission. Notes: Changes in purchasing power due to energy price fluctuations are computed as the year-on-year percentage change in the real price of energy, weighted by the nominal energy expenditure share (see Edelstein, P. and Kilian, L. (2009), “How sensitive are consumer expenditures to retail energy prices?”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 56, No 6, pp. 766-779). A negative value indicates a loss in consumer purchasing power. The latest observations are for January 2022.

Notes: The chart refers to average aggregate effects across the income distribution, to savings cut for those households that have positive savings and rely on them to face the shock, and to dissaving for households that do not have positive savings and thus rely on alternative sources, like accumulated savings or payment deferrals, to face the shock. In 2021 the perceived average price change for utilities was 11%, and for transport services it was 9%. The actual inflation rates for energy items could suffer from an underestimation bias in cases of rising prices because domestic energy consumption is billed with a delay. The latest observations are for January 2022.     Chart 11 Impact of oil price changes on HICP excluding energy and food  (percentage points)   Sources: ECB and ECB staff calculations Notes: The impact of oil price changes on HICP excluding energy and food are computed using the September 2021 basic model elasticities (BMEs) of the forecasting models in use in the national central banks of the Eurosystem.    The path to price stability This uncertainty means the path to price stability is exposed to pitfalls on both sides. As imported inflation now looks set to last longer, we will need to see wages catch up sufficiently to avoid a further fall in purchasing power. If that does not happen, we might face an adverse scenario of a slower closure of the output gap and renewed disinflationary pressures once bad inflation subsides. However, we could be also confronted with an opposite, equally adverse scenario where high inflation proves to be so persistent that it destabilises inflation expectations. That could feed into wage negotiations and domestic price pressures, entrenching inflation above our target.  Whether the economy can avoid these risks and move along a stable path depends crucially on our policy response. In such a finely balanced situation, any errant policy measure could easily push the economy onto the wrong path and put at risk what we have achieved so far. If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery. But if we are too timid in the face of mounting signs that inflation is becoming a domestic process, we might inadvertently give the impression that we lack determination to secure price stability.  In both scenarios, we should not infer the medium-term inflation outlook from present inflation figures. We need to carefully assess the prospects for wage growth, productivity growth and inflation expectations. This requires us to cross-check forward-looking indicators with evidence of what we can observe in the real economy. So far, the labour market is not looking excessively tight, especially in comparison with other jurisdictions (Chart 12, left panel), and even a significant increase in wage growth would not put it much above trend productivity growth plus our inflation target (Chart 12, right panel).[7] Wage growth has remained moderate to date[8], perhaps reflecting workers’ concerns about job security, and the shock from the Ukraine conflict could prompt further caution. Different measures of inflation expectations also show no signs of de-anchoring on the upside (Charts 13 and 14).[9]  Therefore, the danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment. At the same time, I would like to see more evidence that improvements in labour markets are translating into wage growth consistent with our 2% target to be confident that the low-inflation scenario has fully disappeared. Indeed, a key conclusion of our strategy review was that, when coming out of a long period of low inflation, we should wait to see underlying inflation sufficiently advanced before adjusting policy, of which wages are a central component. And option-implied probabilities of tail events suggest that markets still see risks of eventually falling back into a too-low inflation regime.[10]  In the current situation, the task for the ECB is therefore twofold.  First, with the crisis in Ukraine raising uncertainty to unprecedented levels, our immediate priority is to protect the functioning of the financial sector and bolster confidence, in order to contain the impact of the shock on the economy and keep in place the conditions for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  Second, we should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps as the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer.

Note: Values were rounded to one decimal place prior to aggregation.    Accompanying the recovery with a light touch More than 40 years ago, William Brainard proposed the “conservatism principle”, which calls for cautious action when policymakers are faced with uncertainty.[11]  This principle does not apply to all forms of uncertainty. For example, when faced with deflationary shocks that risk rooting interest rates at the lower bound, it pays to act more decisively.[12] The same is true when inflation expectations are at risk of becoming de-anchored.[13] Both these considerations informed the ECB’s resolute response during the first phase of the pandemic.  And if measures to avoid market dislocations prove necessary in response to the war in Ukraine, we should intervene with equal determination, using all our instruments. In this respect, we reiterated in our February decisions that “within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability”. But when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policy on the economy, it is advisable to take small steps – and this is the case for the path out of the pandemic. Confronted with supply shocks that are both inflationary and contractionary, we should adjust our policy moderately and progressively as we receive feedback on the effects of our actions. We began reducing the pace of net asset purchases last year and we are on track to return to our pre-pandemic policy setting by September this year (Chart 15, left panel). Longer-term real yields have already returned to their pre-pandemic levels in the euro area (Chart 15, right panel).  The inflation outlook is stronger today than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, once the current crisis has abated, ensuring that monetary policy accompanies the recovery with a light touch may be consistent with a further adjustment in our net asset purchases. Beyond that, additional modifications to our stance should be considered carefully, for three main reasons.  First, in recent months euro area real yields have already risen more than in the United States, in spite of the different positions in the cycle (Chart 15, right panel). It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2% in a world of tighter financing conditions. This is especially important given that the equilibrium real interest rate is subject to large uncertainty (Chart 16), making it difficult to judge how far away we are from a neutral policy stance. Second, we need to be certain that removing accommodation too suddenly will not trigger market turmoil, as this could lead to financial markets overreacting and financing conditions tightening abruptly. This would set back the recovery in underlying inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at our target. We have already seen that, in the current environment, inflation expectations are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in the expected path of policy. Before the escalation of tensions in Ukraine, markets had brought forward their expectations of rate lift-off. This was associated with a reversal in the improvement of market-based inflation expectations (Chart 17, left panel).[14]  The fact that this decrease in inflation expectations was unique to the euro area[15] might have revealed concerns that the ECB would overreact to current inflation numbers and adjust its monetary policy too much and too quickly. These concerns were also hinted at by the shape of the €STR forward curve, which peaked in 2024 and then inverted somewhat, reflecting investors’ perceptions that the economy would be unable to sustain interest rates at those levels (Chart 17, right panel).  The end of net asset purchases in the euro area in 2018 was smooth mainly because short-term rates remained anchored by our forward guidance. We have not been in a situation before where markets are simultaneously reappraising the path of asset purchases and the path of rates, which could increase term premia along the yield curve. Moreover, markets are reappraising the tightening intentions of all major central banks at the same time, increasing the risk of undesirable spillovers on euro area financing conditions. Third, a key lesson from the previous crisis is not only that rates should not be raised prematurely, but also that doing so without the right framework in place can lead to renewed financial fragmentation. And this fragmentation could force monetary policy into a trade-off: we would face a choice between triggering an excessive tightening of financing conditions in some parts of the euro area, which would result in domestic demand that is too low, or adjusting the stance by less than would be optimal.  Today, fragmentation could result from the legacy effects of the pandemic, so we need a different mechanism for addressing it than during the financial crisis.[16] We have a framework that has served us well over the last two years, when the flexibility of our pandemic emergency purchase programme and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU instrument proved sufficient to stem fragmentation. This gives us a good indication of the direction we should now take. And we know from experience that the more credible a backstop is, the less likely it is to be used.

Faced with high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook with pitfalls on both sides, we should adjust policy carefully and recalibrate it as we see the effects of our decisions, so as to avoid suffocating the recovery and cement progress towards price stability.  That was already the case before the invasion of Ukraine, but this terrible event has made the need for prudence even greater. The world has become darker, and our steps should be smaller still.  At the ECB we stand by the people of Ukraine, who are now seeing what they hold dearest threatened by an unjustifiable act of aggression that violates the most fundamental principles of international law. That a country can be subjected to a full military invasion should steel our determination to defend those principles wherever we are, however we can.  The ECB’s role is clear: we will take any measures necessary, using all our instruments to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets. This is the duty of a central bank in times of emergency. And we will swiftly implement the sanctions decided on by the European Union. The scenes we have witnessed this past week will scar our memories forever. But I hope that, one day, we will look back on this moment and be proud that we did our duty, showed resolve and unity, and sought to uphold the universal values of peace, freedom and prosperity.

Around 60% of items in the inflation basket are currently above 2%, and the share of items that have seen price increases over the last three months is at a record high. Panetta, F. (2021a), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. The effect of higher energy prices is similar to that of a terms of trade tax that the euro area is paying to the rest of the world. See Panetta, F. (2021a), op. cit. Pre-crisis trends do not always represent the right benchmark for the recovery. The great financial crisis, for example, was created by excessive borrowing from the future which then had to be reabsorbed through a prolonged process of deleveraging. But the pandemic was a temporary exogenous shock which should not have significantly reduced the supply capacity of the economy. The pre-crisis growth path is therefore a reasonable standard. Panetta, F. (2021b), “Monetary autonomy in a globalised world”, welcome address at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world”, 26 April. For instance, Russia and Belarus produce large quantities of potash, Ukraine produces rare gases needed to produce lasers used in semi-conductor production, and Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of wheat. The ECB’s survey of large corporates paints a similar picture, foreseeing average wage increases to rise from around 2% in the recent past to 3% or more this year, although with significantly higher rates of wage growth in some sectors with labour shortages. See Gareis, J., Morris, R. and Roma, M. (2022), “Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies”, Economic Bulletin Issue 1, ECB. The average rate of negotiated wages growth was 1.5% in 2021 after 1.8% in 2020 as a whole, below our December projections. Consumers’ expectations, which arguably feed most directly into wage negotiations, show a distinct but temporary “hump” shape compared with January last year (the distribution in January 2022 shifts out for 1-year ahead expectations but shifts back in for 3-year ahead expectations, see Chart 13). Longer-term expectations are also becoming more concentrated around the 2% level compared with a year ago (Chart 14, left panel), while a growing number of monetary analysts see inflation stabilising at 2%, with only a small proportion seeing inflation above this target (Chart 14, right panel). Despite the surge in short-term inflation, recent research analysing the option-implied probabilities of tail events indicates that investors still fear the euro area may fall back into a deflationary trap in the future, whereas for the United States the opposite risk is higher. See Hilscher, J. Raviv Bar-Ilan, A. and Reis, R., (2022), How likely is an inflation disaster?, mimeo, London School of Economics, February. The paper also shows that in 2021 market perceptions of a high-inflation outcome rose significantly for the United States, but not for the euro area. These results (which estimate the tail probabilities for persistently very high or very low inflation using the prices of inflation options) reflect, among other things the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy regime. Brainard, W.C. (1967), —op. cit. In September 2020, for example, I made the argument that “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.” See Panetta, F. (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September. Söderström, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with Uncertain Parameters,” The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No 1, pp. 125-145. This fall is also visible in measures adjusted for risk premia at shorter horizons. In the United States and the United Kingdom measures of inflation expectations have remained broadly unchanged in recent weeks. In the past, the issue was resolved with an instrument – the Outright Monetary Transactions – designed for a situation where the main driver of fragmentation was unsound national policies, for which macroeconomic adjustment programmes were designed. | id_0001 | 2022-02-28 |\n",

This is a sad day for Europe and the world. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. In such times of extreme uncertainty, central banks need to be a source of confidence and a reliable anchor for the economy. Therefore, we are monitoring the situation closely. My remarks today reflect the macroeconomic situation predating the war. In the euro area, inflation has proven more persistent and more broad-based than expected, labour market slack is being reabsorbed at a faster pace than anticipated and pipeline pressures continue to build up. At the same time, prospects are rising that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may herald a turning point in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this environment, monetary policy needs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices today will not jeopardise price stability over the medium term. Households and firms count on the ECB to protect their purchasing power without putting at risk the current strong recovery from the crisis. Our policy framework enables us to deliver on these expectations. Our forward guidance has explicitly defined the conditions that need to be met for policy rates to be raised. And the clear sequence with which we intend to remove monetary stimulus, if and when necessary, reduces the uncertainty about how our actions will affect financing conditions and the broader economy. In the following, I will first discuss the current outlook for inflation. I will then explain the sequencing of policy measures that we will take once the Governing Council judges that policy should be normalised and will elaborate in more detail on three aspects that are more specific to the euro area. The first regards the question as to how the inflation outlook affects the policy normalisation process. The second point relates to how the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area affects the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. And the third point provides thoughts on how our sequence may interact with conditions in sovereign bond markets and the risks of fragmentation. A qualitative and quantitative change in the euro area’s inflation outlook A year ago, there was a widely shared expectation that inflation would rise sharply in response to the reopening of our economies but would subside swiftly as the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic would fade. There was a strong conviction that the combination of statistical base effects, slowing energy price inflation and the removal of one-off tax effects would mark a turning point in the euro area’s inflation trajectory towards the end of last year. These expectations have been disappointed. Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) continued to increase both in December 2021 and in January 2022, when it reached a new historical high of 5.1% (Slide 2). In January, euro area inflation surprised to the upside for the seventh consecutive month. Today, inflation is not only higher than expected, but price pressures are also visibly broadening. Measures of underlying inflation are following an unprecedented upward trend (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The prices of around two-thirds of the goods and services included in the HICP are currently increasing at an annual rate above 2% (Slide 3, right-hand chart). Less than a year ago, this share was close to 20%. Current measured inflation would be even higher if the costs of owner-occupied housing were included. Residential real estate prices continued to increase at an alarming pace. In the third quarter of 2021, prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 9% year-on-year, an unprecedented rate of increase (Slide 4, left-hand chart). If owner-occupied housing were included in the HICP, headline inflation in the third quarter of 2021 would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. For core inflation, the difference would have been twice as much – that is, core inflation would have been 2% rather than 1.4%, which is the largest difference observed since the start of the sample in 2012 (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Looking forward, the broad-based nature of recent upward surprises, extending well beyond the energy component, implies that significant uncertainty remains as to when the inflation peak will eventually be reached. What is becoming increasingly clear is that inflation is unlikely to fall back below our 2% target this year. It may increase even further over the near term before declining gradually over the course of 2022 as energy price inflation should slow. But the decline is not going to be nearly as fast as we previously anticipated. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2% target from above, rather than from below. The start of the year has seen three broad developments that corroborate this view. From pandemic to endemic? First, there are growing signs that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may bring forward the transition towards an endemic equilibrium. Although hospitalisations are still increasing in some countries alongside elevated case counts, admissions to intensive care units and fatality rates are now only a fraction of what they were in previous waves. There is a real chance that the Omicron variant could herald an inflection point after which the global community will be able to live with COVID-19 in spite of possible recurrent episodes of high case numbers. As governments worldwide are easing contact restrictions, the remaining slack in the economy will likely be reabsorbed at a faster pace than previously anticipated, in particular in contact-intensive services where the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on business and sentiment.  The most recent survey data corroborate this view for the euro area. In February, sentiment in the services sector improved sharply, back to levels seen before the discovery of the Omicron variant. A faster and more frontloaded recovery, in turn, risks increasing pressure on wages at a time when the labour market in the euro area is already showing first signs of strain. This brings me to the second point – the recovery in the labour market.  Strong recovery in the labour market Although the pandemic is still raging through the economy, slack in the labour market has continued to decline at a notably faster pace than projected (Slide 5, left-hand chart). A year ago, our central forecast was that the euro area unemployment rate would decline, on average, to 8.1% in 2022. In December 2021, the unemployment rate stood already at 7%. We are currently witnessing the strongest labour market in the history of the single currency. The unemployment rate is at a record low and below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), while the participation rate is at a record high (Slide 5, right-hand chart). Broader labour market slack, too, for which data are lagging, was already reabsorbed, by and large, by the end of the summer of last year, as strong demand is bringing more and more people – also those at the fringes of the labour market – back into work.[1]  While total hours worked still remained below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, there are good reasons to believe that the widespread easing of contact restrictions will help accelerate progress on that front too. Survey evidence confirms the picture of a tightening labour market. A rapidly rising share of firms across all economic sectors report shortages of labour as a factor limiting production. This is now the case for about a quarter to a third of all firms, a level never before observed in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand chart). Vacancy rates across the euro area are significantly higher than before the pandemic, which is consistent with firms reporting continued strong employment demand ahead (Slide 6, right-hand chart). These developments will add to pressure on wages as our economies continue to reopen. Although negotiated wage growth remains moderate, our latest corporate telephone survey among larger firms showed that wage pressures are expected to build up fast. Euro area firms anticipate considerably higher wage increases in the near term. For 2022, their average expected wage increase is 3.5%. The survey also showed that higher input costs, such as wages, are being passed through to consumer prices at a faster pace and to a larger extent than in the past, as strong pent-up demand creates a favourable environment for protecting or boosting profit margins. A faster pass-through, in turn, implies that for medium-term price pressures it is less relevant how fast wages expand today than how fast they will grow this year and next. Pipeline pressures remain elevated Third, pipeline pressures, which affect consumer price inflation with a lag, continue to build up. Import price inflation for intermediate and final consumer goods has increased further and remains at extraordinarily high levels (Slide 7, left-hand chart). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation reached a new all-time high in November. The inflation rate of services producer prices, which are an important element in the cost structure of both manufacturing and services firms, stands at 4.3%, which is almost nine times as high as its historical average. All services sectors report stronger price pressures than before the pandemic. These pipeline pressures will fade only gradually and will likely remain a source of upward pressure for consumer prices over the foreseeable future, with most firms expecting unusual cost pressures to persist for at least another six months. In addition, in large parts of the euro area the recent surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices will only be passed through to consumer prices with a lag. There is also a lot of uncertainty whether energy inflation will decline to the extent suggested by the futures curves underlying our December projections (Slide 7, right-hand chart). Brent oil spot prices are now at their highest levels since 2014 and current futures curves are well above the levels seen at the end of last year. Gas futures prices, too, are markedly higher than in December of last year. While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.[2]  In the EU, price developments under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) signal such an impending structural shift. ETS prices have recently reached a new record high of around €90 per tonne of carbon, almost three times as high as at the beginning of 2021, and they are expected to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. It is a reminder of the challenges we are facing in anticipating potential structural shifts in the underlying inflation process that could extend well beyond the energy sector.[3]  Sequencing of policy normalisation in the euro area All in all, there have been few instances in the recent past where the information set available to policymakers has changed so profoundly and in such a short period of time as has been the case since the beginning of the year. How today’s attack on Ukraine changes the euro area outlook is highly uncertain at this stage. We are monitoring the situation closely and will carefully evaluate the consequences for our policies. Based on the macroeconomic situation predating the war, however, inflationary pressures will likely prove stronger and more persistent over both the near and the medium term. Policy optionality is therefore needed more than ever to protect price stability.[4]  Our decisions in December of last year to end net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and to recalibrate the path of future purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) have been a first important step in this direction. At our next meeting in March, we will reassess whether the current path of asset purchases remains consistent with the updated inflation outlook, and we will thoroughly evaluate the progress made towards meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. While both the calibration and the time of adjustment of our policy instruments are data-dependent, the sequence with which we intend to adjust our policy stance is not. Our sequencing is subject to three guideposts. The first is our rate forward guidance, which provides the anchor for the normalisation process. It defines three conditions that need to be satisfied in the view of the Governing Council for our key policy rates to be raised: first, inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon; second, inflation remaining around 2% durably for the rest of the projection horizon; and, third, realised progress in underlying inflation being consistent with our inflation target. The second guidepost is that we will stop net asset purchases under the APP “shortly before” we increase our main policy rates. “Shortly before” is a term that is deliberately vague. It does not indicate a pre-defined distance between the end of our net asset purchases and policy rate lift-off. It does, however, imply that we will end net asset purchases under the APP once we judge that it is sufficiently likely that the rate forward guidance criteria are going to be fulfilled over the foreseeable future, while rates are going to be raised only when these conditions are actually met. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key policy rates. Again, the notion of an “extended period” is kept open to leave sufficient optionality in order to be able to respond to changes in the inflation outlook. In principle, this sequence is not very different from the one adapted by many other central banks, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. It defines a clear succession of steps that leaves sufficient flexibility to adjust the length of time needed before activating the next step of the sequence. That said, there are three considerations that are more specific to the euro area. Adjusting policy when inflation is converging to target The first relates to the inflation outlook. A central bank that faces a significant risk of inflation being markedly above target over the medium term would need to initiate a rapid sequence of policy rate hikes to above their estimated neutral levels. According to survey and market-based proxies, this would require bringing policy rates well into positive territory (Slide 8). However, these are not the conditions that we are facing today.  Rather, the economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2% target over the medium term. The current inflation outlook therefore calls for a gradual normalisation of our policy stance, reflecting the significant progress made towards meeting our inflation target in the future. During such a process of gradual normalisation, the focus should be first on unwinding step-by-step the exceptional measures we took to fight low inflation, starting with net asset purchases. The degree to which policy will need to be adjusted over time depends on how the inflation outlook continues to evolve. The focus on ending net asset purchases first reflects, at least in part, the fact that their side effects tend to increase over time.[5]  The experience of the past few years demonstrates, for example, that balance sheet policies have a significantly larger impact on house prices than changes in short-term policy rates, thereby contributing to the measurable rise in residential real estate prices (Slide 9).[6]  Similarly, years of balance sheet expansion have caused the bond free float in some economies to decline to very low levels (Slide 10, left-hand chart). As such, an end to net asset purchases enhances the availability of safe assets that the market requires to function well (Slide 10, right-hand chart).[7]  Ending net asset purchases when inflation is robustly converging to our target also credibly underlines that our actions are solely guided by our mandate, refuting concerns about fiscal dominance. Finally, in the current environment of large imported inflation, reversing the current exceptional measures has the potential to mitigate inflationary pressures even without the usual long lag in policy transmission. Over the past years, these measures have contributed to large capital outflows from the euro area, thereby putting downward pressure on the euro exchange rate (Slide 11). The exit from these measures can thus support the currency and, for a net importer of energy, provide tangible and immediate support to euro area households and firms by improving the terms of trade. Choice of policy instruments The second aspect relates to the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. This choice crucially depends on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The euro area remains a bank-based economy. Although market-based debt financing has gained importance since the global financial crisis, bank credit remains by far the dominant source of external finance for euro area firms (Slide 12, left-hand chart).[8]  The financing structure, in turn, has important implications for how strongly a given monetary impulse is transmitted to the real economy. Recent ECB staff analysis finds that when the share of bank loans in total external finance is high, like in the euro area, real GDP growth often shows only a weak response to changes in long-term interest rates (Slide 12, right-hand chart). In other words, our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process. Most of firms’ credit is either linked directly to short-term rates in financial markets, such as the EURIBOR, or has fixed maturities of short duration. Half of outstanding loans to euro area firms have a maturity of one year or less. Long-term rates are not only less relevant for policy transmission, central banks also have only indirect control over the part that is not related to the expected future path of short-term interest rates, i.e. the term premium.  The latter is affected by a host of factors, such as inflation uncertainty, global spillovers or demand by price-insensitive investors. The stock of bonds held by central banks is just one of these factors. Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance. This is also why our sequence foresees that policy lift-off will predate with some distance a reduction of our balance sheet. Risks of fragmentation This brings me to my third consideration – the question as to whether and how changes in sovereign bond market conditions could challenge our sequencing. Despite significant progress in recent years, the euro area’s institutional architecture remains incomplete. In the absence of a common fiscal capacity, and with public debt at elevated levels owing to the pandemic, parts of the euro area remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. There are three mitigating factors at present, however. One is that the combination of a long period of historically low rates and the marked increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt has measurably reduced the sensitivity of debt to changes in market interest rates. The average interest rate will remain low for some time even if the marginal interest rate starts rising (Slide 13, left-hand chart). Second, with average interest rates remaining low, and inflation receding only gradually, the strong expected recovery over the coming years should lead to a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios (Slide 13, right-hand chart). Structural reforms and large-scale investments related to Next Generation EU should foster confidence in the capacity of euro area countries to generate sustained high growth. Third, our decision in December last year to reinvest flexibly under the PEPP provides a strong mechanism to preserve the transmission of monetary policy in the event of severe and self-fulfilling market dislocations that would jeopardise the achievement of our mandate. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter renewed negative shocks related to the pandemic. Hence, we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation, while our monetary policy stance is guided by our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Conclusion Let me conclude. The inflation outlook has firmed since the start of the year. Inflationary pressures have broadened and have become more persistent. The expected easing of contact restrictions, together with the strong recovery in the labour market and elevated pipeline pressures have increased upside risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, the shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook. In this environment, we need to carefully reflect on how much monetary policy stimulus is required for inflation to stabilise at our target over the medium term, so as to neither fall below 2% once the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic fade, nor to allow an extended period of high inflation to become entrenched over time. This uncertainty speaks in favour of a gradual and data-dependent normalisation that respects the sequence that we have communicated, with a view to reducing uncertainty about our actions and intentions.

It is more than 30 years now since the first Anti-money Laundering Directive was published in June 1991. Since then, the framework has undergone many improvements, with the previous – fifth – AML Directive being published in May 2018.  The framework grew both in terms of the number and the forms of the regulatory instruments involved, incorporating both regulations and directives, as well as regulatory technical standards and guidelines developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Market Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. Nevertheless, the AML Directive has remained the core of the legal framework.  The ECB provided opinions on many of those legislative proposals. The ECB does not and cannot have any mandate to exercise anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. However, as my ECB Supervisory Board colleague Edouard Fernandez-Bollo aptly articulated in a recently published blog post: “Some things matter to you, even if you are not directly responsible for them.”  The EU AML/CFT framework affects the ECB’s tasks relating to the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the tasks that fall within its central banking mandate.  In particular, it is important for the ECB to factor the outcomes of AML/CFT supervision into its prudential supervisory processes. The risk of the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing is relevant for ECB prudential supervisory decisions on acquisitions of qualifying holdings in supervised entities, granting and withdrawing authorisations to credit institutions, and suitability assessments of existing or prospective managers of supervised entities. The outcomes of AML/CFT supervision are also reflected in day-to-day supervision as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.  Since the exchange of confidential information between the ECB and the AML/CFT supervisors was enabled in 2018 by an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, the ECB, as a prudential supervisor, has concluded an agreement on information exchange with more than 50 AML/CFT supervisory authorities across all Members States of the European Economic Area. This cooperation was further enhanced by subsequent amendments to the Directive in 2019, as well as by the establishment of AML/CFT colleges, in which the ECB participates as an observer. Over the past years the ECB has also been actively contributing to the work of the EBA’s AML Standing Committee. Good and efficient cooperation with AML/CFT supervisory authorities is therefore an important priority for us. Last year, following discussions in the Council of the EU, the Commission presented a set of legislative proposals for major changes to the EU AML/CFT framework: The first substantial change consists in transforming most of the requirements addressed to private entities from the AML Directive to a directly applicable EU regulation.  The second, and even more fundamental change is the establishment of a new authority at the EU level with a mandate for both direct and indirect AML/CFT supervision across all EU Member States. We see this as an important shift which has the potential to bring a more harmonised application of EU AML/CFT requirements and convergence of practices in AML/CFT supervision across the EU.  The third and most prominent change, which concerns the ECB’s central banking activities, is the introduction of an EU-wide limit to payments in cash. This type of measure has so far only been implemented at the level of individual Member States by means of national legislation. In the past the ECB has opined on a number of such national legislative measures. The legislative package published by the Commission consists of four legislative acts. The ECB was consulted on most elements of the legislative package by the European Parliament and the Council in October 2021. The ECB Governing Council recently adopted and published its opinions on all four elements of the package. My colleagues will give more details on the main themes which the ECB opinions touch upon. Most of the observations and suggestions in the ECB opinions seek to improve the framework of cooperation and information exchange with the future AML Authority, as well as the national AML/CFT authorities.  The ECB incorporated in its opinions its experience from establishing EU-level prudential supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, to the extent that it could be useful in establishing the EU-level AML/CFT supervision. I would like to highlight that the criteria for identifying the selected entities that will be under the direct supervision of the future AML Authority are relatively strict. The Commission envisages that only between 12 and 20 obliged entities will meet these criteria. Based on its experience, the ECB would strongly support amending these criteria such that a wider pool of obliged entities would be directly supervised by the AML Authority, including entities headquartered in each Member State. This would promote a common supervisory culture and convergence of AML/CFT supervisory practices.  Also, considering the strict, risk-based nature of the selection criteria, the publication of the list of selected obliged entities would be tantamount to indirectly disclosing the high money laundering risk status of selected supervised entities, sending unintended signals to the markets or creating reputational issues for selected obliged entities directly supervised by the new AML authority.  The most prominent element of the ECB opinions is the analysis of the proposed limit to cash payments. While the proposed limit of €10,000 euro does not appear problematic, the ECB brings several considerations to the attention of the co-legislators with a view to protecting the legal tender status of euro banknotes, in line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU.  Let me now hand over to my colleagues who will present the ECB opinions in greater detail.

And thank you to the Chair of the panel for allowing me to open the discussion with some remarks on the importance of transition planning. I fully appreciate the irony of what I’m about to say, what with you in Paris and me here on-screen, but we are all on the path to Paris. Citizens, firms, banks and prudential supervisors alike are working towards the climate goals agreed in 2015 as the EU and national governments roll out policies implementing the Paris Agreement.  In previous speeches, I have stressed the need for banks to put in place transition plans compatible with EU policies implementing the Paris Agreement – plans with concrete intermediate milestones to enhance banks’ long-term strategies and decision-making. More and more banks are already doing this themselves, while the European Commission also called for enhanced transition planning in its sustainable finance strategy published in July 2021.  For ECB Banking Supervision, the main concern that needs to be addressed by these transition plans is the level of banks’ risk exposures and the effectiveness of their controls. Have the exposures been sufficiently mitigated and are they prudent? As climate-related and environmental risks become increasingly widespread and more material, banks will, inevitably, be exposed to them, through both physical and transition risks. Banks therefore need adequate risk mitigation measures in place. This is what we need to assess as the prudential supervisor.  Introducing a legal requirement for banks to have a clear, detailed and prudent transition plan in place would increase the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory framework and contribute to maintaining a level playing field. Needless to say, we are very happy to see that this is exactly what the European Commission has proposed in its review of the Capital Requirements Directive, which is now with the co-legislators.  But it doesn’t stop there. For banks to be able to manage their transition risks adequately, they need to have information on how their customers are performing relative to a Paris-aligned transition path. This is where the European Commission’s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive comes in. The ECB welcomed this proposed directive in a legal opinion and it is now awaiting approval by the co-legislators.  The current standards on sustainability disclosure are insufficient to ensure that sustainability-related financial risks are properly understood and priced by market participants. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is a necessary step to address the gaps that currently hinder the development of appropriate sustainability policy, risk assessment and risk monitoring frameworks for the financial sector. This is because it will not only explicitly ask large banks to disclose their transition plans, it will also ask banks’ corporate clients to do the same. This last point is crucial, as it will enable banks to assess the climate-related and environmental risks in their asset portfolios. These disclosures are therefore an important element in ensuring that banks manage all material risks, in line with what we as the prudential supervisor expect them to do.  The climate-and-environmental puzzle is still highly complicated, but we can now see the pieces slotting into place. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the elements included in the Commission’s proposals are implemented in actual binding legislation entering into force without undue delay. This will smooth the path to Paris for all.

Throughout history, money and payments have been constantly evolving. And this also holds true in the digital age. As we increasingly pay digitally and shop online, we rely less on cash. Our wallets are gradually moving from our pockets to smartphones and other electronic devices.  These changes have profound implications for the nature of money itself, raising the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies for retail use.  Today I will argue that in a digital world CBDCs are necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilising force at the heart of the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty.  But CBDCs will need to be carefully designed. To be successful, they will need to add value for users, support competition rather than crowd out private innovation, and avoid risks to financial intermediation.  Why we need central bank digital money Our monetary system is based on the complementarity of private money with public money – which is available for retail payments in the form of banknotes.[1]  Confidence in private means of payment is determined by our ability to convert private money into safe public money. This is because central bank money is a risk-free form of money that is guaranteed by the State: by its strength, its credibility, its authority.  Other types of money are liabilities of private issuers: their value is based on the soundness of the issuer and is underpinned by the promise of one-to-one convertibility with central bank money.[2] Our readiness to hold private money such as bank deposits reflects the confidence that we can always go to a branch or a cash machine and convert our deposits into cash. The fact that we can do this tells us that our deposits are safe. It reassures us that we will be able to convert them into risk-free central bank money in the future, too.  Bank runs and financial crises start when confidence in the convertibility of private money evaporates.[3] Without the anchor of sovereign money, people would constantly have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money. This would undermine confidence in the singleness of money and impair the functioning of the payments system.[4]  History provides examples for this. In times when various forms of private money coexisted in the absence of sovereign money – such as the free banking era of the 19th century – the notes issued by banks often traded at variable prices[5] and instability risks[6] required dominant banks and clearinghouses to act as quasi-central banks[7]. The consensus among central banks on the coexistence between public and private money was summarised 20 years ago as follows: “The composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency. In other words, central banks would accept neither an outcome in which central bank money crowds out private initiative, nor an outcome in which central bank money is phased out by a market mechanism.”[8]  In the digital age, however, banknotes could lose their role as a reference value in payments, undermining the integrity of the monetary system.[9] Central banks must therefore consider how to ensure that their money can remain a payments anchor in a digital world.  Some have suggested that innovative private payment solutions such as stablecoins could, if properly regulated, make CBDCs superfluous.[10] However, confidence in stablecoins would also depend on the ability to convert them into central bank money,[11] unless stablecoin issuers were allowed to invest the reserve assets in risk-free deposits at the central bank. But this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money, which would endanger monetary sovereignty.[12] Moreover, in the absence of public money, stablecoins could exacerbate the “winner-takes-all” dynamics inherent in payment markets, with adverse consequences for the functioning of the payments system.[13] And stablecoins’ potentially large investments in safe assets could affect the availability of these assets.[14] This could in turn have an impact on market functioning and real interest rates, with undesirable implications from a monetary policy perspective.[15]  Other threats to monetary sovereignty could emerge in the absence of a domestic digital currency. If a foreign CBDC were to be widely adopted, this could lead to digital currency substitution[16]. This risk would be higher for small countries with unstable currencies and weak fundamentals, especially if the CBDC were issued in a major economy.[17] But it could eventually also affect leading currencies.[18]  Such risks are not imminent, but they should not be underestimated. Just as the US dollar overtook the pound sterling as the leading reserve currency within only a decade of the end of the First World War,[19] digital innovation may give rise to powerful new foreign contenders, with disruptive consequences for those markets that are not prepared to face the digital challenge.  The widespread adoption of a foreign CBDC would increase the risk of financial transactions being based on technologies managed and supervised elsewhere, with limited oversight by domestic authorities. A system of this kind may not have sufficient safeguards against external threats, including cyber threats. It could put the confidential data of people, businesses, and states at greater risk of being misused. And it could make the information needed to counter criminal activities harder to trace.  The scenario I am describing is not one of science fiction. It is already the case in the market for crypto-assets, which are widely used for criminal activities.[20] A similar situation might affect other digital asset markets in the future. So the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted, and this will make a big difference.[21] But it may not be sufficient.  The main benefits of CBDCs  A CBDC would preserve the coexistence of sovereign and private money in a digital world. This is not an abstract benefit – it is the basis for financial and monetary stability, ensuring competition and efficiency in payment markets. But a CBDC could generate even more benefits for users.  It could improve the confidentiality of digital payments. The information contained in electronic transactions can be monetised by private companies[22], posing a threat to privacy. This risk is further compounded by big techs starting to offer financial services and by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Data protection regulation aims to prevent misuse, but cannot always keep pace with technological innovation, as we have seen in past cases of data breaches and misuse by tech companies.[23]  If a digital currency were offered by an independent public institution such as the central bank – which has no interest in exploiting individual payment data for any purpose – it could enhance, not reduce, the confidentiality of electronic payments. Potential users clearly want this: when we consulted the public on the topic, privacy was identified as the most important aspect of a digital euro.[24] Sound governance arrangements that comply with data protection regulations would ensure that payment information is only accessed for permitted purposes, such as countering illegal activities. We are cooperating with the relevant European authorities on this issue.  A digital euro would also increase choice and reduce costs, contributing to a level playing field in payments.[25] Key segments of the euro area payments market, such as cards and e-payments, are dominated by a handful of players, which strengthens their pricing power. Some estimates suggest that Europeans pay about 1.4% of GDP for payments services. In the United States, the costs are higher.[26]  One might argue that private service providers are already well equipped to offer low-cost digital payment solutions. However, the limited evidence available suggests that low-income households use digital payments less than high-income households. This is consistent with the hypothesis that digital payments remain expensive for many users.[27] And even in advanced financial systems, many citizens are “unbanked” or “underbanked”.[28] Although financial inclusion depends on several factors, such as financial and digital literacy, the cost of financial services is likely to play a role.  Our digital euro project comes with a commitment that all – including vulnerable population groups – will have access to safe public money in the digital era.  Designing a successful digital euro  The fact that CBDCs are necessary to guarantee the smooth functioning of the payments market does not mean that their success should be taken for granted. Users may lack incentives to fully appreciate such benefit and – given the vast supply of private digital monies – could show limited interest in CBDCs. Indeed, we face two opposite risks: being “too successful” and crowding out private payment solutions and financial intermediation, or being “not successful enough” and generating insufficient demand. We take both risks seriously.  To avoid interfering with the functioning of the financial system, we are considering how to make the digital euro a convenient medium of exchange but not an attractive form of investment. We are examining the pros and cons of introducing a quantitative cap on digital euro holdings[29] or a tiered remuneration that would disincentivise excessive holdings.[30] We are analysing the potential impact on monetary policy. To ensure that our digital currency would be a convenient means of payment, we are working to make it available within private payment solutions, so that people would be able to use it easily wherever they can pay digitally. We aim to level the playing field by allowing intermediaries – including small ones – to offer innovative solutions to their customers. And we are considering how a digital euro could improve financial inclusion. We are interviewing focus groups to identify the characteristics of a digital euro that would add value for users. And we are working on the technical options to reconcile different objectives such as the right of individuals to confidentiality versus the public interest in guaranteeing the transparency required to counter illegal activities; or the benefits of allowing the digital euro to be widely used versus the need to safeguard financial intermediation.  We have launched several work streams: on the design choices that can guarantee confidentiality, on the prioritisation of different use cases,[31] and on the business options for intermediaries[32]. We will cover areas such as cyber security and operational resilience.  We are interacting with all relevant stakeholders, from intermediaries to consumers, merchants and authorities. We are cooperating with the European Parliament, the European Commission and the finance ministers of the euro area countries. To get technical advice and collect a broad range of views on possible solutions, we have set up a Market Advisory Group[33] and are regularly discussing the project with the Euro Retail Payments Board[34], academics and think tanks. Bearing in mind the international implications of CBDCs,[35] we are cooperating with other major central banks. In October 2021 we launched a two-year investigation phase to define the design features of the digital currency. At the end of 2023 we could decide to start a realisation phase to develop and test the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro, which could take three years. Only thereafter will we decide whether to actually issue a digital euro.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  For decades, the complementarity of public money and private money has guaranteed stability, competition and innovation.  The digitalisation of payments cannot be ignored by central banks, which have so far provided their money only in physical form. Central banks cannot escape these transformations, nor should they underestimate the potential for far-reaching shifts that may occur.  To ensure that public money maintains its fundamental role in the digital age, the ECB has launched an investigation into the possible issuance of a digital euro alongside cash.  The digital euro is an ambitious and complex project that can improve the efficiency of the economic and financial system. We want to make it a driver of stability and inclusive progress, capable of strengthening ties between economies and financial systems around the world. Our experience may provide useful insights for other central banks. And likewise, we are keen to learn from them. I am therefore pleased to exchange views with US experts, and I am now looking forward to our discussion.    Although central bank money can also take the form of reserves (deposits that commercial banks hold at the central bank), the focus of this speech will be on cash. One-to-one convertibility with central bank money is what makes the regulated forms of money convertible with each other and is why they are perceived as interchangeable when making payments. This does not mean that the safeguards put in place to protect savings – legislation and banking supervision, deposit insurance schemes, capital markets supervision – are not important. On the contrary. They must, however, be flanked by convertibility to ensure the smooth functioning of payments and the stability of the financial system. On the singleness of money see Bank for International Settlements (2003),  The role of central bank money in payment systems , Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, August. For instance, the notes of new banks were more heavily discounted. See Gorton, G. (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No 2, pp. 346-397. Price variability was inconvenient, as users had to consult a note reporter to monitor the value of the notes in circulation. See Eichengreen, B. (2019), “From Commodity to Fiat and Now to Crypto: What Does History Tell Us?”, NBER Working Paper Series, No 25426, January. The experience of the free banking era in the United States varied considerably among states and each had a significant number of problem banks. See Rolnick, A.J. and Weber, W.E. (1983), “New Evidence on the Free Banking Era”, American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No 5, pp. 1080-1091. In the United States, dominant banks disciplined note issuing banks by threatening them with bulk redemption of their notes, while clearinghouses regulated member bank levels of equity, reserves, and interest rates, audited members, produced money during crises and issued a form of insurance; See Gorton, G. (1985), “Banking theory and free banking history: A Review Essay”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 16(2), 267-276. See Bank for International Settlements (2003), op. cit. For an overview of the role of central bank money over the past 20 years, see Bindseil, U., and Terol, I (2020), “The evolving role of central bank money in payments”, Central Banking, 15 July. While banks could continue to hold central bank money in the form of reserves, this may not prove sufficient to fully preserve the monetary anchor role of central bank money. People would be unable to use central bank money as means of exchange and would thus have little incentive to hold it. This would weaken the unit of account role of sovereign money. If the currency is not demanded by the public, the mere announcement that the central bank would make it available would not be enough to preserve its role in the economy. In history, sovereign money was at times used as unit of account but not as a medium of exchange. This was for example the case of the livre, the “imaginary money” introduced by Charlemagne in the monetary reform of the eighth century, named after the libra (pound), the sovereign money introduced by the ancient King of Rome Servius Tullius in the sixth century BC. The livre was never coined and never circulated. However, it had a fixed conversion rate with another form of sovereign money, the denier (1 livre was equal to 240 deniers), which was actually coined and actively used as means of exchange.

The value of a stablecoin is linked to a portfolio of one or more other assets (the reserve assets), including currency in the form of commercial bank deposits. Stablecoins can therefore be low-risk but not risk-free. Risks increase if stablecoin arrangements are backed by risky or opaque assets, especially in times of market turmoil.

New players, including operating platforms with huge customer bases, can exploit network effects and economies of scale to build dominant positions, creating their own closed-loop ecosystems. They may exploit customer data for private scoring and other uses. They may erect barriers to impede interoperability and use their “coins” to displace other forms of money.

While the international role of a currency will continue to depend to a large extent on the fundamentals of the underlying economy, availability in CBDC form would facilitate use in cross-border payments by reducing frictions and costs. Model simulations suggest that the share of a country’s currency in global export payments increases when it is available as a CBDC, but continues to depend to a large extent on forces such as the size and the stability of the economy and the development and efficiency of the financial sector.

The European Union is revising the regulation, supervision and oversight of digital finance with the proposed Regulation of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and the ECB’s new payment oversight framework (PISA). The discussion on regulatory steps is also ongoing in other advanced economies, e.g. in the United States.

Beyond the well-known case of Oxford Analytica, big tech firms are facing increased criticism over revelations that staff and contractors listened to audio recordings of people speaking to virtual assistants, and voice chats recorded on messenger apps. Even children were affected: one major video-sharing app popular among young people was heavily fined in 2019 by the US Federal Trade Commission for collecting personal data from children under 13. See New Scientist (2019),  Big tech data abuse capped off Silicon Valley's decade-long fall , 18 December. In the public consultation conducted by the ECB in 2020, 43% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of a digital euro, well ahead of other features. The other characteristics highlighted in the consultation were the security of payments and usability throughout the euro area, which were ranked first by 18% and 11% of those surveyed, respectively. See Panetta, F. (2021), “A digital euro to meet the expectations of Europeans”, introductory remarks at the ECON Committee of the European Parliament, 14 April. See Panetta, F.

See McKinsey (2020),  The 2020 McKinsey Global Payments Report.  Based on the Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE), the preference for cash in the euro area is significantly higher among low-income respondents. While only 36% of those with an income of €1,000 per month or less have a preference for cards or other cashless means of payment, that preference was expressed by 61% in the income bracket of €2,500 and more. See Panetta, F. (2021), “Cash still king in times of COVID-19”, speech at the Deutsche Bundesbank’s 5th International Cash Conference on “Cash in times of turmoil”, 15 June. Although they are often invisible to the customer, the various layers of merchant fees can add up to some 3% of the transaction value. According to Glory Global Solutions, “Some banks tell merchants to budget for between 2.5% and 3% of the transaction valuable, but with so many variables, this is only ever a rough guide.” See Glory Global Solutions (2018),  Electronic Payments – Not As Cheap As You Think . In the United States, 6% of adults do not have a checking, savings, or money market account. See Federal Reserve (2019),  Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2018 - May 2019 . In the euro area there are still more than 5% of adults without a payment account. See World Bank (2017),  Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database  .  In the case of quantitative holding limits, we are considering waterfall solutions linking digital euro accounts to private money accounts, to allow payments in excess of the limit. Bindseil, U.

Use cases refer to the various interactions between people, businesses, Government and machines (e.g. payments at the point of sale, online, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, etc.). Business options are naturally related to costs (fees, devices), but can also include the front end, taking into account consumers’ preference to use the current payment methods, be it their smartphone, card or cash. A digital euro should provide a similar payment experience, while also considering future innovations like QR codes, which are becoming more and more popular. The Market Advisory Group includes 30 professionals from the retail payments industry and provides advice on the design and potential role of a digital euro in the payments ecosystem.

Our focus today is the current state of C&amp;E risk management practices in the banking sector, and the ECB’s upcoming thematic review of these risks. Over the last couple of years, we have launched several targeted actions in this direction. In 2020 we issued the ECB guide on C&amp;E risks and in 2021 we conducted a supervisory review of banks’ approaches to managing these risks based on their own assessments. The ECB has progressively taken C&amp;E risks into greater account in its supervision, as have banks in their business.  2022 will be the year that C&amp;E risks become integrated in the day-to-day activities of our joint supervisory teams, who are in constant contact with banks. These risks will come to form an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with supervised entities and the supervisory review and evaluation process, the SREP. This will ultimately influence banks’ minimum capital requirements. The encompassing and integrated approach – which supervisors and banks are already very familiar with for traditional risk categories – is what I call the immersive supervisory approach to C&amp;E risks. Along with the 2022 ECB supervisory stress test, the thematic review forms part of the ECB Banking Supervision roadmap to ensure that banks adequately incorporate C&amp;E risk management. These supervisory activities complement the ECB’s broader C&amp;E agenda, which includes publishing the results of an economy-wide climate change stress test, and our 2021 action plan to include climate change considerations in our monetary policy. The state of C&amp;E risk management  Climate and environmental risks are impossible to avoid. The public knows it and the ECB knows it. The banks themselves now know it, as reflected in the outcome of their internal assessments. All banks that thoroughly assessed their exposure to C&amp;E risks concluded that these risks are material. By contrast, not a single materiality assessment submitted by banks that reported no material risk exposure was deemed adequate. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the banks that acknowledged the materiality of the C&amp;E risks they faced did so for both transition and physical risks. And they acknowledged that these risks are material in both the short and the long term. Despite this broad acknowledgement of the materiality of these risks, and thus the need to adequately manage them, we see that most banks still have a considerable way to go in developing their risk management capabilities. As the findings we published last year show, banks reported that 90% of their practices are only partially or not at all in line with ECB supervisory expectations. Let me repeat: 90%. This is both bad news and good news. Bad news because, at the time of their assessment, banks were a long way away from where they needed to be. But good news because half the banks we supervise already acknowledge that climate risks are an inevitable part of their day-to-day business. We therefore expect banks to analyse how C&amp;E risks can or will affect their portfolios and products over the short, medium and long term, and under various scenarios, too. This type of forward-looking analysis of C&amp;E risk should be basic practice, just as it would be for any other type of risk. Moreover, beyond merely formally attributing responsibilities, we still see banks making little progress towards more actively managing the C&amp;E risks they face. Even certain banks that recognise the materiality of C&amp;E risks have not reported any practices to either reduce or manage their level of risk. This year we want to see firm progress in how banks incorporate C&amp;E risks in their risk management. In doing so, banks should adopt a strategic approach to managing these risks, using the full array of the risk management instruments at their disposal. This includes strategically realigning portfolios, setting clear risk appetites, developing mitigation strategies, adjusting qualitative credit criteria and quantifying and holding capital. Another key area in which banks can make progress is by actively supporting their clients in mitigating and adapting to the different types of climate and environmental risks. Moreover, banks can draw on the industry’s good practices that we shared last year in our report. In the face of data challenges and methodological uncertainties, banks have an even stronger imperative to get moving. To be clear, banks should not misconstrue the ECB’s actions as an outright call for divesting from carbon-intensive activities or from geographical regions vulnerable to physical risk. Rather, we are asking banks to fully grasp the physical and transition risks and to actively start managing them, with the aim of making their portfolios more resilient to C&amp;E risks. Not all sectors will decarbonise overnight. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios show that certain sectors will continue to rely on carbon-intensive technologies for some time. We as prudential supervisors merely need banks to understand what the transition entails for their risk exposures to those sectors, and to reflect it in their overall risk management strategy. What we do not expect is an outright withdrawal from carbon-intensive industries, nor do we expect it to happen for every single sector or counterparty – but we do expect banks to harbour the capacity to manage the risks emerging from climate change. To draw a comparison with traditional risk exposures, we, as supervisors, would of course not expect banks to divest from all assets that entail credit risks, but we do insist that these risks are managed appropriately. C&amp;E risks are to be managed just like any other risk; and their sound management requires sound risk controls. This is precisely one of our focus areas in the upcoming thematic review on C&amp;E risks. Supervisory roadmap for C&amp;E risks For several years, the ECB has identified banks’ exposure to C&amp;E risks as one of the main vulnerabilities in the European banking sector. Assessing and helping banks address risks stemming from climate change and environmental degradation will be one of our supervisory priorities from now until 2024, albeit these risks have been on our minds for far longer. I remember giving my first speeches on this topic in late 2015 when still an executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank. So, we have already come a long way and our supervision of C&amp;E risks will now take more concrete form. The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&amp;E risks.  The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&amp;E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the banks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front.  The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C&amp;E risks, which is a key topic of the session today. Two years after we launched the supervisory guide on C&amp;E risks, we are conducting this thematic review to follow up on the self-assessment exercise conducted last year. Our main goal will be to assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks’ C&amp;E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C&amp;E risk strategies and risk profiles. Do all banks’ processes and analyses have visible consequences? Does the way in which banks actually steer their balance sheets and risk profiles reflect the materiality of C&amp;E risks? These will be some of the core questions of this review.  As part of this exercise, we will monitor banks’ alignment with the supervisory expectations set out in the guide, and encourage banks’ progress towards the industry’s best practices. Fortunately, those practices were identified across different European banks over the last two years. They show that some banks are already doing what we are asking. The ECB is doing its part by guiding banks in their climate journey, setting forth supervisory expectations and sharing updates on good practices in the industry. In light of the efforts banks have already made in devising their action plans, as well as all the information on this topic published to date – by both the ECB and several other public and private organisations we expect to see material progress in banks’ implementation deadlines and concrete actions.  As part of the thematic review, we will also be looking more closely at the risk management practices for environmental risks such as risks to biodiversity, water stress and pollution. All have similar features and warrant a coordinated approach. Banks can make significant savings if, taking advantage of the momentum, they extend the range of their preparations to cover all these risks, and are thus ready for a new, more concrete, supervisory and regulatory environment. Our benchmark from last year shows that, as of early 2021, very few banks were looking into environmental risks beyond climate. We have highlighted this gap to banks. This year, we will assess how banks are managing their exposures to environmental risks beyond climate and follow up accordingly.  As we build our joint supervisory teams’ capacity to help banks understand and incorporate C&amp;E risks, our supervisors will treat these risks just like any other. Last year’s review was conducted by a central team of experts, with the joint supervisory teams conducting the follow-up dialogue with the bank. By contrast, this thematic review will be fully embedded in the work of every joint supervisory team. While still backed by a central team of experts, the review will be driven from the engine room of supervision. And this is where the supervision of C&amp;E risks will stay. Following up on the thematic review, all banks under our direct supervision will receive comprehensive feedback setting out any shortcomings identified. Combined with the observations from the climate stress test, this will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. Targeted qualitative requirements may also be imposed. As part of the review, we will also carefully check whether banks have followed up on any requirements we issued last year. The thematic review is a full-on supervisory review. As such, we also have the full set of supervisory measures at our disposal to address shortcomings. Those banks that continue to fail to conduct a materiality assessment of C&amp;E risks or have not followed-up on earlier requirements will start noticing just that. Regulatory and supervisory framework  The ECB is taking action under its mandate and under the current prudential framework to get banks to where they need to be in terms of incorporating C&amp;E risks into their business. Our supervisory activities are thus keeping in line with the rapidly evolving regulatory and supervisory framework.  For example, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive proposed by the European Commission will further articulate the integration of C&amp;E risks in the legal framework and will require banks to develop transition plans and supervisors to scrutinise them. This is the next important step in risk management, which I have mentioned on previous occasions, and which will require banks to look thirty years ahead and devise intermediate targets for their risk exposures that can render their risk management practices fit for an economy that will transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.  And finally, disclosure frameworks and taxonomies are also developing rapidly to create an information architecture to enable banks to manage the risks and scale up green finance. Both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have intensive work programmes to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework can better cater for climate-related risks. One concrete example is the EBA’s recently published implementing technical standards for the disclosure of Environmental Social and Governance risks, which also require large banks to start disclosing their alignment with the IEA pathways by June 2024 at the latest for all relevant portfolios. Banks are running out of time to complete their preparations. On all these fronts, the sooner banks act, the smoother the transition will be for them, and for the economy they help support.  Conclusion  For ECB Banking Supervision, 2022 marks the third year of dedicated C&amp;E risk activities. First, we issued our guide with supervisory expectations. Next, we asked banks to share with us their self-assessments on how their practices match our expectations. And they have indeed been very open and candid in these self-assessments, for which I am truly grateful.  Together we have learnt that there is a lot of room for improvement. Considering the importance, urgency and long-lasting nature of climate change, we are asking banks to intensify their efforts in measuring and managing C&amp;E risks in line with our expectations. With the exercises that we are conducting this year, the prudential supervision of climate-related risks is moving closer to maturity. The thematic review is the next step in fully immersing C&amp;E risks in the work of the joint supervisory teams and marks key progress towards their integration in the SREP. It crystalises our commitment to ensuring that the prudential supervision of C&amp;E risks is here to stay.



       "1    SPEECH  Small steps in a dark room: guiding policy on the path out of the pandemic   Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at an online seminar organised by the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies and Florence School of Banking and Finance at the European University Institute Frankfurt am Main, 28 February 2022 After many years of too-low inflation in the euro area, fears have turned to the prospect that inflation may remain too high for too long. Across advanced economies, the current inflation spike is proving to be broader and more persistent than initially expected, leading central banks to reassess the risk that it could become entrenched. This is no easy task, especially in the euro area.  Economic conditions in the euro area have benefited from the strong response of monetary policy and its positive interactions with fiscal policy during the pandemic. But this is not a typical business cycle, and we are not seeing a typical recovery.  The current inflation spike is for the most part not being driven by domestic factors – by an economy that is “running hot”, in other words. Demand remains below its pre-crisis trend.  Instead, the economy is experiencing a series of imported supply shocks that are pushing up inflation and depressing demand. The exit from the pandemic is characterised by global mismatches between demand and supply – in energy and goods markets in particular – with uneven effects across sectors.  As a result, past economic regularities may be a poor guide for the future.  This makes medium-term developments extremely hard to anticipate. There are forces at play that could delay the recovery and contain underlying price pressures, and others that could lead to accelerating inflation. Policy mistakes in either direction could push the economy onto an unfavourable path.  Faced with such uncertainty, there is a case for the central bank to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps in adjusting policy, so as not to suffocate the as yet incomplete recovery.  If we are to durably escape the low inflation and low growth environment that has defined the past decade, we cannot afford to waste the progress we have made so far. In the spirit of William Brainard[1], we should take small steps in a dark room. The dramatic conflict in Ukraine is now weighing negatively on both supply and demand conditions, making uncertainty more acute and exacerbating risks to the medium-term inflation outlook on both sides. In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer. And the ECB stands ready to act to avoid any dislocation in financial markets that could stem from the war in Ukraine and to protect the transmission of monetary policy.  Inflation as an imported phenomenon The recent inflation data in the euro area do not make for easy reading. Headline inflation reached 5% in January and is expected to stay above 2% for the entire year, while core inflation is at 2.3%. Inflation pressures are becoming widespread (Chart 1).[2]  To determine how monetary policy should respond, we need to understand the drivers of this inflation spike. I have previously spoken about “good”, “bad” and “ugly” inflation in this context, and each of these has different implications for policy.[3]  In short, good inflation is driven by domestic demand and wages consistent with our target, which monetary policy should seek to nurture until that target is reached. Bad inflation instead reflects negative supply shocks that raise prices and depress economic activity, which monetary policy should look through. Ugly inflation – the worst type of inflation – is driven by a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which monetary policy should immediately stamp out. Data indicate that bad inflation is still dominating in the euro area today.  Unlike in the United States, our economy is not experiencing excess domestic demand. Household nominal income has not recovered its pre-pandemic trend and households are saving more of their income than they did before the pandemic (Chart 2). Consumer spending and investment both remain well below their pre-crisis trends (Chart 3). Inflation is largely imported, reflecting global shocks to supply and demand that are spilling over to our economy through import prices (Chart 4, left panel).  Around 60% of inflation in January was energy, of which the euro area is a net importer (Chart 4, right panel). This is the consequence of the recent extraordinary increases in oil and gas prices (Chart 5, left panel). These in turn mainly reflect shocks that compress energy supply, rather than stronger aggregate demand (Chart 5, right panel). The rise in the cost of energy has further accelerated after the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Inflation is also being fuelled by the global shift in consumer spending from services to manufactured goods at a time when the pandemic has disrupted production. This has translated into global supply chain bottlenecks, high durable goods prices and strong pipeline pressures. This effect, which also represents a supply shock for the euro area, is now being reabsorbed, but at a different pace in different economies (Chart 6).  These global supply-driven increases in prices – above all energy and industrial goods, but also food – explain a good part of the currently high headline inflation (Chart 7, left panel).  In contrast, services inflation – the most domestic inflation component – has so far largely come from high-contact sectors (Chart 7, right panel). These sectors are experiencing frictions created by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and some of them (such as transport services) are also sensitive to energy prices.

Uncertainty in the inflation outlook Imported supply shocks that underpin bad inflation increase the uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook in two main ways.  First, energy-driven inflation acts as a “tax”[4] on consumption and a brake on production, over time generating effects akin to an adverse demand shock. This adds to the uncertainty around the growth outlook, making it harder to judge when the economy is likely to reach full capacity. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the economy was seeing a bounceback after the slowdown created by the Omicron wave. But we were still some way short of returning to our pre-crisis GDP trend, across a range of possible estimates (Chart 8). In my view, GDP reaching the bottom end of this range would be the bare minimum needed to conclude that resources are fully utilised[5] – and current projections suggest that this will not happen until the middle of 2023.  The terms of trade tax from higher energy prices could further delay the return to that growth path. The heavier energy bill has already reduced household purchasing power by around 2% (Chart 9, left panel) and is negatively affecting consumer confidence (Chart 9, right panel). It is also eroding the financial buffers built up during the pandemic, especially for households with low incomes, reducing the degree to which dissaving can support consumption in the future (Chart 10). Second, prolonged imported price shocks make it harder to assess whether inflation is feeding into domestic price pressures. The fact that core inflation is increasing above 2% may initially seem to suggest that domestic inflationary pressures are accumulating. However, rising core inflation is partly due to higher energy prices, which are pushing up costs in almost all sectors (Chart 11). Similarly, industrial goods inflation may remain elevated in the near term due to higher input costs, but beyond that its dynamics are hard to predict. Inventory levels are starting to return to normal, which suggests that demand might have peaked. The memory of supply shortages might prompt firms to build precautionary stocks that initially prolong tensions but ultimately lead to excess inventories once bottlenecks ease. This would amplify the manufacturing cycle and the volatility of goods inflation.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now intensifying this uncertainty.  We face greater financial volatility in the short term. There is a risk of renewed market dislocations as investors anticipate the potential impact of sanctions and possible retaliatory actions. And these dislocations might be felt unevenly, threatening the smooth transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area. But we also face greater macroeconomic uncertainty in the medium term. The higher energy prices triggered by the conflict in Ukraine point to a longer period of above-target inflation, while supply disruptions of raw materials and food could prove more persistent[6]. At the same time, these factors increase the terms of trade tax and depress economic confidence, aggravating downside risks to growth and further delaying the return to full capacity.

Chart 9 Impact of “bad” inflation on demand    Sources: Left panel: ECB and ECB staff calculations; right panel: European Commission. Notes: Changes in purchasing power due to energy price fluctuations are computed as the year-on-year percentage change in the real price of energy, weighted by the nominal energy expenditure share (see Edelstein, P. and Kilian, L. (2009), “How sensitive are consumer expenditures to retail energy prices?”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 56, No 6, pp. 766-779). A negative value indicates a loss in consumer purchasing power. The latest observations are for January 2022.

Notes: The chart refers to average aggregate effects across the income distribution, to savings cut for those households that have positive savings and rely on them to face the shock, and to dissaving for households that do not have positive savings and thus rely on alternative sources, like accumulated savings or payment deferrals, to face the shock. In 2021 the perceived average price change for utilities was 11%, and for transport services it was 9%. The actual inflation rates for energy items could suffer from an underestimation bias in cases of rising prices because domestic energy consumption is billed with a delay. The latest observations are for January 2022.

The path to price stability This uncertainty means the path to price stability is exposed to pitfalls on both sides. As imported inflation now looks set to last longer, we will need to see wages catch up sufficiently to avoid a further fall in purchasing power. If that does not happen, we might face an adverse scenario of a slower closure of the output gap and renewed disinflationary pressures once bad inflation subsides. However, we could be also confronted with an opposite, equally adverse scenario where high inflation proves to be so persistent that it destabilises inflation expectations. That could feed into wage negotiations and domestic price pressures, entrenching inflation above our target.  Whether the economy can avoid these risks and move along a stable path depends crucially on our policy response. In such a finely balanced situation, any errant policy measure could easily push the economy onto the wrong path and put at risk what we have achieved so far. If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery. But if we are too timid in the face of mounting signs that inflation is becoming a domestic process, we might inadvertently give the impression that we lack determination to secure price stability.  In both scenarios, we should not infer the medium-term inflation outlook from present inflation figures. We need to carefully assess the prospects for wage growth, productivity growth and inflation expectations. This requires us to cross-check forward-looking indicators with evidence of what we can observe in the real economy. So far, the labour market is not looking excessively tight, especially in comparison with other jurisdictions (Chart 12, left panel), and even a significant increase in wage growth would not put it much above trend productivity growth plus our inflation target (Chart 12, right panel).[7] Wage growth has remained moderate to date[8], perhaps reflecting workers’ concerns about job security, and the shock from the Ukraine conflict could prompt further caution. Different measures of inflation expectations also show no signs of de-anchoring on the upside (Charts 13 and 14).[9]  Therefore, the danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment. At the same time, I would like to see more evidence that improvements in labour markets are translating into wage growth consistent with our 2% target to be confident that the low-inflation scenario has fully disappeared. Indeed, a key conclusion of our strategy review was that, when coming out of a long period of low inflation, we should wait to see underlying inflation sufficiently advanced before adjusting policy, of which wages are a central component. And option-implied probabilities of tail events suggest that markets still see risks of eventually falling back into a too-low inflation regime.[10]  In the current situation, the task for the ECB is therefore twofold.  First, with the crisis in Ukraine raising uncertainty to unprecedented levels, our immediate priority is to protect the functioning of the financial sector and bolster confidence, in order to contain the impact of the shock on the economy and keep in place the conditions for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  Second, we should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps as the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer.

Note: Values were rounded to one decimal place prior to aggregation.    Accompanying the recovery with a light touch More than 40 years ago, William Brainard proposed the “conservatism principle”, which calls for cautious action when policymakers are faced with uncertainty.[11]  This principle does not apply to all forms of uncertainty. For example, when faced with deflationary shocks that risk rooting interest rates at the lower bound, it pays to act more decisively.[12] The same is true when inflation expectations are at risk of becoming de-anchored.[13] Both these considerations informed the ECB’s resolute response during the first phase of the pandemic.  And if measures to avoid market dislocations prove necessary in response to the war in Ukraine, we should intervene with equal determination, using all our instruments. In this respect, we reiterated in our February decisions that “within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability”. But when policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policy on the economy, it is advisable to take small steps – and this is the case for the path out of the pandemic. Confronted with supply shocks that are both inflationary and contractionary, we should adjust our policy moderately and progressively as we receive feedback on the effects of our actions. We began reducing the pace of net asset purchases last year and we are on track to return to our pre-pandemic policy setting by September this year (Chart 15, left panel). Longer-term real yields have already returned to their pre-pandemic levels in the euro area (Chart 15, right panel).  The inflation outlook is stronger today than it was before the pandemic. Therefore, once the current crisis has abated, ensuring that monetary policy accompanies the recovery with a light touch may be consistent with a further adjustment in our net asset purchases. Beyond that, additional modifications to our stance should be considered carefully, for three main reasons.  First, in recent months euro area real yields have already risen more than in the United States, in spite of the different positions in the cycle (Chart 15, right panel). It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2% in a world of tighter financing conditions. This is especially important given that the equilibrium real interest rate is subject to large uncertainty (Chart 16), making it difficult to judge how far away we are from a neutral policy stance. Second, we need to be certain that removing accommodation too suddenly will not trigger market turmoil, as this could lead to financial markets overreacting and financing conditions tightening abruptly. This would set back the recovery in underlying inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations at our target. We have already seen that, in the current environment, inflation expectations are highly sensitive to abrupt changes in the expected path of policy. Before the escalation of tensions in Ukraine, markets had brought forward their expectations of rate lift-off. This was associated with a reversal in the improvement of market-based inflation expectations (Chart 17, left panel).[14]  The fact that this decrease in inflation expectations was unique to the euro area[15] might have revealed concerns that the ECB would overreact to current inflation numbers and adjust its monetary policy too much and too quickly. These concerns were also hinted at by the shape of the €STR forward curve, which peaked in 2024 and then inverted somewhat, reflecting investors’ perceptions that the economy would be unable to sustain interest rates at those levels (Chart 17, right panel).  The end of net asset purchases in the euro area in 2018 was smooth mainly because short-term rates remained anchored by our forward guidance. We have not been in a situation before where markets are simultaneously reappraising the path of asset purchases and the path of rates, which could increase term premia along the yield curve. Moreover, markets are reappraising the tightening intentions of all major central banks at the same time, increasing the risk of undesirable spillovers on euro area financing conditions. Third, a key lesson from the previous crisis is not only that rates should not be raised prematurely, but also that doing so without the right framework in place can lead to renewed financial fragmentation. And this fragmentation could force monetary policy into a trade-off: we would face a choice between triggering an excessive tightening of financing conditions in some parts of the euro area, which would result in domestic demand that is too low, or adjusting the stance by less than would be optimal.  Today, fragmentation could result from the legacy effects of the pandemic, so we need a different mechanism for addressing it than during the financial crisis.[16] We have a framework that has served us well over the last two years, when the flexibility of our pandemic emergency purchase programme and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU instrument proved sufficient to stem fragmentation. This gives us a good indication of the direction we should now take. And we know from experience that the more credible a backstop is, the less likely it is to be used.

Faced with high uncertainty surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook with pitfalls on both sides, we should adjust policy carefully and recalibrate it as we see the effects of our decisions, so as to avoid suffocating the recovery and cement progress towards price stability.  That was already the case before the invasion of Ukraine, but this terrible event has made the need for prudence even greater. The world has become darker, and our steps should be smaller still.  At the ECB we stand by the people of Ukraine, who are now seeing what they hold dearest threatened by an unjustifiable act of aggression that violates the most fundamental principles of international law. That a country can be subjected to a full military invasion should steel our determination to defend those principles wherever we are, however we can.  The ECB’s role is clear: we will take any measures necessary, using all our instruments to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets. This is the duty of a central bank in times of emergency. And we will swiftly implement the sanctions decided on by the European Union. The scenes we have witnessed this past week will scar our memories forever. But I hope that, one day, we will look back on this moment and be proud that we did our duty, showed resolve and unity, and sought to uphold the universal values of peace, freedom and prosperity.    Brainard, W.C. (1967), “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 57, No 2, pp. 411-425. Around 60% of items in the inflation basket are currently above 2%, and the share of items that have seen price increases over the last three months is at a record high. Panetta, F. (2021a), “Patient monetary policy amid a rocky recovery”, speech at Sciences Po, 24 November. The effect of higher energy prices is similar to that of a terms of trade tax that the euro area is paying to the rest of the world. See Panetta, F. (2021a), op. cit. Pre-crisis trends do not always represent the right benchmark for the recovery. The great financial crisis, for example, was created by excessive borrowing from the future which then had to be reabsorbed through a prolonged process of deleveraging. But the pandemic was a temporary exogenous shock which should not have significantly reduced the supply capacity of the economy. The pre-crisis growth path is therefore a reasonable standard. Panetta, F. (2021b), “Monetary autonomy in a globalised world”, welcome address at the joint BIS, BoE, ECB and IMF conference on “Spillovers in a “post-pandemic, low-for-long” world”, 26 April. For instance, Russia and Belarus produce large quantities of potash, Ukraine produces rare gases needed to produce lasers used in semi-conductor production, and Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of wheat. The ECB’s survey of large corporates paints a similar picture, foreseeing average wage increases to rise from around 2% in the recent past to 3% or more this year, although with significantly higher rates of wage growth in some sectors with labour shortages. See Gareis, J., Morris, R. and Roma, M. (2022), “Main findings from the ECB’s recent contacts with non-financial companies”, Economic Bulletin Issue 1, ECB. The average rate of negotiated wages growth was 1.5% in 2021 after 1.8% in 2020 as a whole, below our December projections. Consumers’ expectations, which arguably feed most directly into wage negotiations, show a distinct but temporary “hump” shape compared with January last year (the distribution in January 2022 shifts out for 1-year ahead expectations but shifts back in for 3-year ahead expectations, see Chart 13). Longer-term expectations are also becoming more concentrated around the 2% level compared with a year ago (Chart 14, left panel), while a growing number of monetary analysts see inflation stabilising at 2%, with only a small proportion seeing inflation above this target (Chart 14, right panel). Despite the surge in short-term inflation, recent research analysing the option-implied probabilities of tail events indicates that investors still fear the euro area may fall back into a deflationary trap in the future, whereas for the United States the opposite risk is higher. See Hilscher, J. Raviv Bar-Ilan, A. and Reis, R., (2022), How likely is an inflation disaster?, mimeo, London School of Economics, February. The paper also shows that in 2021 market perceptions of a high-inflation outcome rose significantly for the United States, but not for the euro area. These results (which estimate the tail probabilities for persistently very high or very low inflation using the prices of inflation options) reflect, among other things the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy regime. Brainard, W.C. (1967), —op. cit. In September 2020, for example, I made the argument that “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.” See Panetta, F. (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September. Söderström, U. (2002), “Monetary Policy with Uncertain Parameters,” The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol. 104, No 1, pp. 125-145. This fall is also visible in measures adjusted for risk premia at shorter horizons. In the United States and the United Kingdom measures of inflation expectations have remained broadly unchanged in recent weeks. In the past, the issue was resolved with an instrument – the Outright Monetary Transactions – designed for a situation where the main driver of fragmentation was unsound national policies, for which macroeconomic adjustment programmes were designed.\n",
       "2    SPEECH  Finding the right sequence   Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a virtual policy panel on “Unwinding QE” at the first annual Bank of England Agenda for Research (BEAR) conference Frankfurt am Main, 24 February 2022 The terrible act of aggression and the shock of war that we are witnessing in the heart of Europe overshadow today’s conference. This is a sad day for Europe and the world. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. In such times of extreme uncertainty, central banks need to be a source of confidence and a reliable anchor for the economy. Therefore, we are monitoring the situation closely. My remarks today reflect the macroeconomic situation predating the war. In the euro area, inflation has proven more persistent and more broad-based than expected, labour market slack is being reabsorbed at a faster pace than anticipated and pipeline pressures continue to build up. At the same time, prospects are rising that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may herald a turning point in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In this environment, monetary policy needs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices today will not jeopardise price stability over the medium term. Households and firms count on the ECB to protect their purchasing power without putting at risk the current strong recovery from the crisis. Our policy framework enables us to deliver on these expectations. Our forward guidance has explicitly defined the conditions that need to be met for policy rates to be raised. And the clear sequence with which we intend to remove monetary stimulus, if and when necessary, reduces the uncertainty about how our actions will affect financing conditions and the broader economy. In the following, I will first discuss the current outlook for inflation. I will then explain the sequencing of policy measures that we will take once the Governing Council judges that policy should be normalised and will elaborate in more detail on three aspects that are more specific to the euro area. The first regards the question as to how the inflation outlook affects the policy normalisation process. The second point relates to how the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area affects the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. And the third point provides thoughts on how our sequence may interact with conditions in sovereign bond markets and the risks of fragmentation. A qualitative and quantitative change in the euro area’s inflation outlook A year ago, there was a widely shared expectation that inflation would rise sharply in response to the reopening of our economies but would subside swiftly as the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic would fade. There was a strong conviction that the combination of statistical base effects, slowing energy price inflation and the removal of one-off tax effects would mark a turning point in the euro area’s inflation trajectory towards the end of last year. These expectations have been disappointed. Headline inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) continued to increase both in December 2021 and in January 2022, when it reached a new historical high of 5.1% (Slide 2). In January, euro area inflation surprised to the upside for the seventh consecutive month. Today, inflation is not only higher than expected, but price pressures are also visibly broadening. Measures of underlying inflation are following an unprecedented upward trend (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The prices of around two-thirds of the goods and services included in the HICP are currently increasing at an annual rate above 2% (Slide 3, right-hand chart). Less than a year ago, this share was close to 20%. Current measured inflation would be even higher if the costs of owner-occupied housing were included. Residential real estate prices continued to increase at an alarming pace. In the third quarter of 2021, prices for houses and flats in the euro area increased by 9% year-on-year, an unprecedented rate of increase (Slide 4, left-hand chart). If owner-occupied housing were included in the HICP, headline inflation in the third quarter of 2021 would have been 0.3 percentage points higher. For core inflation, the difference would have been twice as much – that is, core inflation would have been 2% rather than 1.4%, which is the largest difference observed since the start of the sample in 2012 (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Looking forward, the broad-based nature of recent upward surprises, extending well beyond the energy component, implies that significant uncertainty remains as to when the inflation peak will eventually be reached. What is becoming increasingly clear is that inflation is unlikely to fall back below our 2% target this year. It may increase even further over the near term before declining gradually over the course of 2022 as energy price inflation should slow. But the decline is not going to be nearly as fast as we previously anticipated. In addition, it is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2% target from above, rather than from below. The start of the year has seen three broad developments that corroborate this view. From pandemic to endemic? First, there are growing signs that the fast spread of the Omicron variant may bring forward the transition towards an endemic equilibrium. Although hospitalisations are still increasing in some countries alongside elevated case counts, admissions to intensive care units and fatality rates are now only a fraction of what they were in previous waves. There is a real chance that the Omicron variant could herald an inflection point after which the global community will be able to live with COVID-19 in spite of possible recurrent episodes of high case numbers. As governments worldwide are easing contact restrictions, the remaining slack in the economy will likely be reabsorbed at a faster pace than previously anticipated, in particular in contact-intensive services where the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on business and sentiment.  The most recent survey data corroborate this view for the euro area. In February, sentiment in the services sector improved sharply, back to levels seen before the discovery of the Omicron variant. A faster and more frontloaded recovery, in turn, risks increasing pressure on wages at a time when the labour market in the euro area is already showing first signs of strain. This brings me to the second point – the recovery in the labour market.  Strong recovery in the labour market Although the pandemic is still raging through the economy, slack in the labour market has continued to decline at a notably faster pace than projected (Slide 5, left-hand chart). A year ago, our central forecast was that the euro area unemployment rate would decline, on average, to 8.1% in 2022. In December 2021, the unemployment rate stood already at 7%. We are currently witnessing the strongest labour market in the history of the single currency. The unemployment rate is at a record low and below estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), while the participation rate is at a record high (Slide 5, right-hand chart). Broader labour market slack, too, for which data are lagging, was already reabsorbed, by and large, by the end of the summer of last year, as strong demand is bringing more and more people – also those at the fringes of the labour market – back into work.[1]  While total hours worked still remained below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, there are good reasons to believe that the widespread easing of contact restrictions will help accelerate progress on that front too. Survey evidence confirms the picture of a tightening labour market. A rapidly rising share of firms across all economic sectors report shortages of labour as a factor limiting production. This is now the case for about a quarter to a third of all firms, a level never before observed in the euro area (Slide 6, left-hand chart). Vacancy rates across the euro area are significantly higher than before the pandemic, which is consistent with firms reporting continued strong employment demand ahead (Slide 6, right-hand chart). These developments will add to pressure on wages as our economies continue to reopen. Although negotiated wage growth remains moderate, our latest corporate telephone survey among larger firms showed that wage pressures are expected to build up fast. Euro area firms anticipate considerably higher wage increases in the near term. For 2022, their average expected wage increase is 3.5%. The survey also showed that higher input costs, such as wages, are being passed through to consumer prices at a faster pace and to a larger extent than in the past, as strong pent-up demand creates a favourable environment for protecting or boosting profit margins. A faster pass-through, in turn, implies that for medium-term price pressures it is less relevant how fast wages expand today than how fast they will grow this year and next. Pipeline pressures remain elevated Third, pipeline pressures, which affect consumer price inflation with a lag, continue to build up. Import price inflation for intermediate and final consumer goods has increased further and remains at extraordinarily high levels (Slide 7, left-hand chart). At the later stages of the pricing chain, domestic producer price inflation reached a new all-time high in November. The inflation rate of services producer prices, which are an important element in the cost structure of both manufacturing and services firms, stands at 4.3%, which is almost nine times as high as its historical average. All services sectors report stronger price pressures than before the pandemic. These pipeline pressures will fade only gradually and will likely remain a source of upward pressure for consumer prices over the foreseeable future, with most firms expecting unusual cost pressures to persist for at least another six months. In addition, in large parts of the euro area the recent surge in wholesale electricity and gas prices will only be passed through to consumer prices with a lag. There is also a lot of uncertainty whether energy inflation will decline to the extent suggested by the futures curves underlying our December projections (Slide 7, right-hand chart). Brent oil spot prices are now at their highest levels since 2014 and current futures curves are well above the levels seen at the end of last year. Gas futures prices, too, are markedly higher than in December of last year. While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.[2]  In the EU, price developments under the Emissions Trading System (ETS) signal such an impending structural shift. ETS prices have recently reached a new record high of around €90 per tonne of carbon, almost three times as high as at the beginning of 2021, and they are expected to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. It is a reminder of the challenges we are facing in anticipating potential structural shifts in the underlying inflation process that could extend well beyond the energy sector.[3]  Sequencing of policy normalisation in the euro area All in all, there have been few instances in the recent past where the information set available to policymakers has changed so profoundly and in such a short period of time as has been the case since the beginning of the year. How today’s attack on Ukraine changes the euro area outlook is highly uncertain at this stage. We are monitoring the situation closely and will carefully evaluate the consequences for our policies. Based on the macroeconomic situation predating the war, however, inflationary pressures will likely prove stronger and more persistent over both the near and the medium term. Policy optionality is therefore needed more than ever to protect price stability.[4]  Our decisions in December of last year to end net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March and to recalibrate the path of future purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) have been a first important step in this direction. At our next meeting in March, we will reassess whether the current path of asset purchases remains consistent with the updated inflation outlook, and we will thoroughly evaluate the progress made towards meeting the conditions of our rate forward guidance. While both the calibration and the time of adjustment of our policy instruments are data-dependent, the sequence with which we intend to adjust our policy stance is not. Our sequencing is subject to three guideposts. The first is our rate forward guidance, which provides the anchor for the normalisation process. It defines three conditions that need to be satisfied in the view of the Governing Council for our key policy rates to be raised: first, inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of our projection horizon; second, inflation remaining around 2% durably for the rest of the projection horizon; and, third, realised progress in underlying inflation being consistent with our inflation target. The second guidepost is that we will stop net asset purchases under the APP “shortly before” we increase our main policy rates. “Shortly before” is a term that is deliberately vague. It does not indicate a pre-defined distance between the end of our net asset purchases and policy rate lift-off. It does, however, imply that we will end net asset purchases under the APP once we judge that it is sufficiently likely that the rate forward guidance criteria are going to be fulfilled over the foreseeable future, while rates are going to be raised only when these conditions are actually met. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising our key policy rates. Again, the notion of an “extended period” is kept open to leave sufficient optionality in order to be able to respond to changes in the inflation outlook. In principle, this sequence is not very different from the one adapted by many other central banks, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. It defines a clear succession of steps that leaves sufficient flexibility to adjust the length of time needed before activating the next step of the sequence. That said, there are three considerations that are more specific to the euro area. Adjusting policy when inflation is converging to target The first relates to the inflation outlook. A central bank that faces a significant risk of inflation being markedly above target over the medium term would need to initiate a rapid sequence of policy rate hikes to above their estimated neutral levels. According to survey and market-based proxies, this would require bringing policy rates well into positive territory (Slide 8). However, these are not the conditions that we are facing today.  Rather, the economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2% target over the medium term. The current inflation outlook therefore calls for a gradual normalisation of our policy stance, reflecting the significant progress made towards meeting our inflation target in the future. During such a process of gradual normalisation, the focus should be first on unwinding step-by-step the exceptional measures we took to fight low inflation, starting with net asset purchases. The degree to which policy will need to be adjusted over time depends on how the inflation outlook continues to evolve. The focus on ending net asset purchases first reflects, at least in part, the fact that their side effects tend to increase over time.[5]  The experience of the past few years demonstrates, for example, that balance sheet policies have a significantly larger impact on house prices than changes in short-term policy rates, thereby contributing to the measurable rise in residential real estate prices (Slide 9).[6]  Similarly, years of balance sheet expansion have caused the bond free float in some economies to decline to very low levels (Slide 10, left-hand chart). As such, an end to net asset purchases enhances the availability of safe assets that the market requires to function well (Slide 10, right-hand chart).[7]  Ending net asset purchases when inflation is robustly converging to our target also credibly underlines that our actions are solely guided by our mandate, refuting concerns about fiscal dominance. Finally, in the current environment of large imported inflation, reversing the current exceptional measures has the potential to mitigate inflationary pressures even without the usual long lag in policy transmission. Over the past years, these measures have contributed to large capital outflows from the euro area, thereby putting downward pressure on the euro exchange rate (Slide 11). The exit from these measures can thus support the currency and, for a net importer of energy, provide tangible and immediate support to euro area households and firms by improving the terms of trade. Choice of policy instruments The second aspect relates to the choice of policy instruments at different stages of the normalisation process. This choice crucially depends on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The euro area remains a bank-based economy. Although market-based debt financing has gained importance since the global financial crisis, bank credit remains by far the dominant source of external finance for euro area firms (Slide 12, left-hand chart).[8]  The financing structure, in turn, has important implications for how strongly a given monetary impulse is transmitted to the real economy. Recent ECB staff analysis finds that when the share of bank loans in total external finance is high, like in the euro area, real GDP growth often shows only a weak response to changes in long-term interest rates (Slide 12, right-hand chart). In other words, our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process. Most of firms’ credit is either linked directly to short-term rates in financial markets, such as the EURIBOR, or has fixed maturities of short duration. Half of outstanding loans to euro area firms have a maturity of one year or less. Long-term rates are not only less relevant for policy transmission, central banks also have only indirect control over the part that is not related to the expected future path of short-term interest rates, i.e. the term premium.  The latter is affected by a host of factors, such as inflation uncertainty, global spillovers or demand by price-insensitive investors. The stock of bonds held by central banks is just one of these factors. Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance. This is also why our sequence foresees that policy lift-off will predate with some distance a reduction of our balance sheet. Risks of fragmentation This brings me to my third consideration – the question as to whether and how changes in sovereign bond market conditions could challenge our sequencing. Despite significant progress in recent years, the euro area’s institutional architecture remains incomplete. In the absence of a common fiscal capacity, and with public debt at elevated levels owing to the pandemic, parts of the euro area remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. There are three mitigating factors at present, however. One is that the combination of a long period of historically low rates and the marked increase in the weighted average maturity of public debt has measurably reduced the sensitivity of debt to changes in market interest rates. The average interest rate will remain low for some time even if the marginal interest rate starts rising (Slide 13, left-hand chart). Second, with average interest rates remaining low, and inflation receding only gradually, the strong expected recovery over the coming years should lead to a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios (Slide 13, right-hand chart). Structural reforms and large-scale investments related to Next Generation EU should foster confidence in the capacity of euro area countries to generate sustained high growth. Third, our decision in December last year to reinvest flexibly under the PEPP provides a strong mechanism to preserve the transmission of monetary policy in the event of severe and self-fulfilling market dislocations that would jeopardise the achievement of our mandate. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter renewed negative shocks related to the pandemic. Hence, we stand ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation, while our monetary policy stance is guided by our primary objective of maintaining price stability. Conclusion Let me conclude. The inflation outlook has firmed since the start of the year. Inflationary pressures have broadened and have become more persistent. The expected easing of contact restrictions, together with the strong recovery in the labour market and elevated pipeline pressures have increased upside risks to inflation over the medium term. At the same time, the shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook. In this environment, we need to carefully reflect on how much monetary policy stimulus is required for inflation to stabilise at our target over the medium term, so as to neither fall below 2% once the extraordinary factors related to the pandemic fade, nor to allow an extended period of high inflation to become entrenched over time. This uncertainty speaks in favour of a gradual and data-dependent normalisation that respects the sequence that we have communicated, with a view to reducing uncertainty about our actions and intentions.

       "3    SPEECH  Towards a stronger AML/CTF framework in the EU   Welcome address by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, during a seminar presenting the ECB Opinions on the proposed regulation establishing the AML/CFT Authority, AML Regulation, the sixth AML Directive and the Funds and Crypto-assets Transfers Regulation Brussels, 23 February 2022 The EU framework for the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing already has a long history. It is more than 30 years now since the first Anti-money Laundering Directive was published in June 1991. Since then, the framework has undergone many improvements, with the previous – fifth – AML Directive being published in May 2018.  The framework grew both in terms of the number and the forms of the regulatory instruments involved, incorporating both regulations and directives, as well as regulatory technical standards and guidelines developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Market Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. Nevertheless, the AML Directive has remained the core of the legal framework.  The ECB provided opinions on many of those legislative proposals. The ECB does not and cannot have any mandate to exercise anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervision. However, as my ECB Supervisory Board colleague Edouard Fernandez-Bollo aptly articulated in a recently published blog post: “Some things matter to you, even if you are not directly responsible for them.”  The EU AML/CFT framework affects the ECB’s tasks relating to the prudential supervision of banks, as well as the tasks that fall within its central banking mandate.  In particular, it is important for the ECB to factor the outcomes of AML/CFT supervision into its prudential supervisory processes. The risk of the use of the financial system for money laundering or terrorist financing is relevant for ECB prudential supervisory decisions on acquisitions of qualifying holdings in supervised entities, granting and withdrawing authorisations to credit institutions, and suitability assessments of existing or prospective managers of supervised entities. The outcomes of AML/CFT supervision are also reflected in day-to-day supervision as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process.  Since the exchange of confidential information between the ECB and the AML/CFT supervisors was enabled in 2018 by an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, the ECB, as a prudential supervisor, has concluded an agreement on information exchange with more than 50 AML/CFT supervisory authorities across all Members States of the European Economic Area. This cooperation was further enhanced by subsequent amendments to the Directive in 2019, as well as by the establishment of AML/CFT colleges, in which the ECB participates as an observer. Over the past years the ECB has also been actively contributing to the work of the EBA’s AML Standing Committee. Good and efficient cooperation with AML/CFT supervisory authorities is therefore an important priority for us. Last year, following discussions in the Council of the EU, the Commission presented a set of legislative proposals for major changes to the EU AML/CFT framework: The first substantial change consists in transforming most of the requirements addressed to private entities from the AML Directive to a directly applicable EU regulation.  The second, and even more fundamental change is the establishment of a new authority at the EU level with a mandate for both direct and indirect AML/CFT supervision across all EU Member States. We see this as an important shift which has the potential to bring a more harmonised application of EU AML/CFT requirements and convergence of practices in AML/CFT supervision across the EU.  The third and most prominent change, which concerns the ECB’s central banking activities, is the introduction of an EU-wide limit to payments in cash. This type of measure has so far only been implemented at the level of individual Member States by means of national legislation. In the past the ECB has opined on a number of such national legislative measures. The legislative package published by the Commission consists of four legislative acts. The ECB was consulted on most elements of the legislative package by the European Parliament and the Council in October 2021. The ECB Governing Council recently adopted and published its opinions on all four elements of the package. My colleagues will give more details on the main themes which the ECB opinions touch upon. Most of the observations and suggestions in the ECB opinions seek to improve the framework of cooperation and information exchange with the future AML Authority, as well as the national AML/CFT authorities.  The ECB incorporated in its opinions its experience from establishing EU-level prudential supervision within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, to the extent that it could be useful in establishing the EU-level AML/CFT supervision. I would like to highlight that the criteria for identifying the selected entities that will be under the direct supervision of the future AML Authority are relatively strict. The Commission envisages that only between 12 and 20 obliged entities will meet these criteria. Based on its experience, the ECB would strongly support amending these criteria such that a wider pool of obliged entities would be directly supervised by the AML Authority, including entities headquartered in each Member State. This would promote a common supervisory culture and convergence of AML/CFT supervisory practices.  Also, considering the strict, risk-based nature of the selection criteria, the publication of the list of selected obliged entities would be tantamount to indirectly disclosing the high money laundering risk status of selected supervised entities, sending unintended signals to the markets or creating reputational issues for selected obliged entities directly supervised by the new AML authority.  The most prominent element of the ECB opinions is the analysis of the proposed limit to cash payments. While the proposed limit of €10,000 euro does not appear problematic, the ECB brings several considerations to the attention of the co-legislators with a view to protecting the legal tender status of euro banknotes, in line with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU.  Let me now hand over to my colleagues who will present the ECB opinions in greater detail.

       "4    SPEECH  Prudential pathways to Paris   Contribution by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, on the panel “Sustainable finance: what is expected from transition scenarios?” at the Eurofi High Level Seminar 2022 Frankfurt am Main, 23 February 2022 Many thanks to the organisers for letting me participate remotely in this panel alongside such distinguished speakers. And thank you to the Chair of the panel for allowing me to open the discussion with some remarks on the importance of transition planning. I fully appreciate the irony of what I’m about to say, what with you in Paris and me here on-screen, but we are all on the path to Paris. Citizens, firms, banks and prudential supervisors alike are working towards the climate goals agreed in 2015 as the EU and national governments roll out policies implementing the Paris Agreement.  In previous speeches, I have stressed the need for banks to put in place transition plans compatible with EU policies implementing the Paris Agreement – plans with concrete intermediate milestones to enhance banks’ long-term strategies and decision-making. More and more banks are already doing this themselves, while the European Commission also called for enhanced transition planning in its sustainable finance strategy published in July 2021.  For ECB Banking Supervision, the main concern that needs to be addressed by these transition plans is the level of banks’ risk exposures and the effectiveness of their controls. Have the exposures been sufficiently mitigated and are they prudent? As climate-related and environmental risks become increasingly widespread and more material, banks will, inevitably, be exposed to them, through both physical and transition risks. Banks therefore need adequate risk mitigation measures in place. This is what we need to assess as the prudential supervisor.  Introducing a legal requirement for banks to have a clear, detailed and prudent transition plan in place would increase the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory framework and contribute to maintaining a level playing field. Needless to say, we are very happy to see that this is exactly what the European Commission has proposed in its review of the Capital Requirements Directive, which is now with the co-legislators.  But it doesn’t stop there. For banks to be able to manage their transition risks adequately, they need to have information on how their customers are performing relative to a Paris-aligned transition path. This is where the European Commission’s proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive comes in. The ECB welcomed this proposed directive in a legal opinion and it is now awaiting approval by the co-legislators.  The current standards on sustainability disclosure are insufficient to ensure that sustainability-related financial risks are properly understood and priced by market participants. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is a necessary step to address the gaps that currently hinder the development of appropriate sustainability policy, risk assessment and risk monitoring frameworks for the financial sector. This is because it will not only explicitly ask large banks to disclose their transition plans, it will also ask banks’ corporate clients to do the same. This last point is crucial, as it will enable banks to assess the climate-related and environmental risks in their asset portfolios. These disclosures are therefore an important element in ensuring that banks manage all material risks, in line with what we as the prudential supervisor expect them to do.  The climate-and-environmental puzzle is still highly complicated, but we can now see the pieces slotting into place. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the elements included in the Commission’s proposals are implemented in actual binding legislation entering into force without undue delay. This will smooth the path to Paris for all.

       "5    SPEECH  Central bank digital currencies: defining the problems, designing the solutions   Contribution by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, to a panel discussion on central bank digital currencies at the US Monetary Policy Forum New York, 18 February 2022 It is a great pleasure to take part in this panel on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Throughout history, money and payments have been constantly evolving. And this also holds true in the digital age. As we increasingly pay digitally and shop online, we rely less on cash. Our wallets are gradually moving from our pockets to smartphones and other electronic devices.  These changes have profound implications for the nature of money itself, raising the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies for retail use.  Today I will argue that in a digital world CBDCs are necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilising force at the heart of the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty.  But CBDCs will need to be carefully designed. To be successful, they will need to add value for users, support competition rather than crowd out private innovation, and avoid risks to financial intermediation.  Why we need central bank digital money Our monetary system is based on the complementarity of private money with public money – which is available for retail payments in the form of banknotes.[1]  Confidence in private means of payment is determined by our ability to convert private money into safe public money. This is because central bank money is a risk-free form of money that is guaranteed by the State: by its strength, its credibility, its authority.  Other types of money are liabilities of private issuers: their value is based on the soundness of the issuer and is underpinned by the promise of one-to-one convertibility with central bank money.[2] Our readiness to hold private money such as bank deposits reflects the confidence that we can always go to a branch or a cash machine and convert our deposits into cash. The fact that we can do this tells us that our deposits are safe. It reassures us that we will be able to convert them into risk-free central bank money in the future, too.  Bank runs and financial crises start when confidence in the convertibility of private money evaporates.[3] Without the anchor of sovereign money, people would constantly have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money. This would undermine confidence in the singleness of money and impair the functioning of the payments system.[4]  History provides examples for this. In times when various forms of private money coexisted in the absence of sovereign money – such as the free banking era of the 19th century – the notes issued by banks often traded at variable prices[5] and instability risks[6] required dominant banks and clearinghouses to act as quasi-central banks[7]. The consensus among central banks on the coexistence between public and private money was summarised 20 years ago as follows: “The composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency. In other words, central banks would accept neither an outcome in which central bank money crowds out private initiative, nor an outcome in which central bank money is phased out by a market mechanism.”[8]  In the digital age, however, banknotes could lose their role as a reference value in payments, undermining the integrity of the monetary system.[9] Central banks must therefore consider how to ensure that their money can remain a payments anchor in a digital world.  Some have suggested that innovative private payment solutions such as stablecoins could, if properly regulated, make CBDCs superfluous.[10] However, confidence in stablecoins would also depend on the ability to convert them into central bank money,[11] unless stablecoin issuers were allowed to invest the reserve assets in risk-free deposits at the central bank. But this would be tantamount to outsourcing the provision of central bank money, which would endanger monetary sovereignty.[12] Moreover, in the absence of public money, stablecoins could exacerbate the “winner-takes-all” dynamics inherent in payment markets, with adverse consequences for the functioning of the payments system.[13] And stablecoins’ potentially large investments in safe assets could affect the availability of these assets.[14] This could in turn have an impact on market functioning and real interest rates, with undesirable implications from a monetary policy perspective.[15]  Other threats to monetary sovereignty could emerge in the absence of a domestic digital currency. If a foreign CBDC were to be widely adopted, this could lead to digital currency substitution[16]. This risk would be higher for small countries with unstable currencies and weak fundamentals, especially if the CBDC were issued in a major economy.[17] But it could eventually also affect leading currencies.[18]  Such risks are not imminent, but they should not be underestimated. Just as the US dollar overtook the pound sterling as the leading reserve currency within only a decade of the end of the First World War,[19] digital innovation may give rise to powerful new foreign contenders, with disruptive consequences for those markets that are not prepared to face the digital challenge.  The widespread adoption of a foreign CBDC would increase the risk of financial transactions being based on technologies managed and supervised elsewhere, with limited oversight by domestic authorities. A system of this kind may not have sufficient safeguards against external threats, including cyber threats. It could put the confidential data of people, businesses, and states at greater risk of being misused. And it could make the information needed to counter criminal activities harder to trace.  The scenario I am describing is not one of science fiction. It is already the case in the market for crypto-assets, which are widely used for criminal activities.[20] A similar situation might affect other digital asset markets in the future. So the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted, and this will make a big difference.[21] But it may not be sufficient.  The main benefits of CBDCs  A CBDC would preserve the coexistence of sovereign and private money in a digital world. This is not an abstract benefit – it is the basis for financial and monetary stability, ensuring competition and efficiency in payment markets. But a CBDC could generate even more benefits for users.  It could improve the confidentiality of digital payments. The information contained in electronic transactions can be monetised by private companies[22], posing a threat to privacy. This risk is further compounded by big techs starting to offer financial services and by the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Data protection regulation aims to prevent misuse, but cannot always keep pace with technological innovation, as we have seen in past cases of data breaches and misuse by tech companies.[23]  If a digital currency were offered by an independent public institution such as the central bank – which has no interest in exploiting individual payment data for any purpose – it could enhance, not reduce, the confidentiality of electronic payments. Potential users clearly want this: when we consulted the public on the topic, privacy was identified as the most important aspect of a digital euro.[24] Sound governance arrangements that comply with data protection regulations would ensure that payment information is only accessed for permitted purposes, such as countering illegal activities. We are cooperating with the relevant European authorities on this issue.  A digital euro would also increase choice and reduce costs, contributing to a level playing field in payments.[25] Key segments of the euro area payments market, such as cards and e-payments, are dominated by a handful of players, which strengthens their pricing power. Some estimates suggest that Europeans pay about 1.4% of GDP for payments services. In the United States, the costs are higher.[26]  One might argue that private service providers are already well equipped to offer low-cost digital payment solutions. However, the limited evidence available suggests that low-income households use digital payments less than high-income households. This is consistent with the hypothesis that digital payments remain expensive for many users.[27] And even in advanced financial systems, many citizens are “unbanked” or “underbanked”.[28] Although financial inclusion depends on several factors, such as financial and digital literacy, the cost of financial services is likely to play a role.  Our digital euro project comes with a commitment that all – including vulnerable population groups – will have access to safe public money in the digital era.  Designing a successful digital euro  The fact that CBDCs are necessary to guarantee the smooth functioning of the payments market does not mean that their success should be taken for granted. Users may lack incentives to fully appreciate such benefit and – given the vast supply of private digital monies – could show limited interest in CBDCs. Indeed, we face two opposite risks: being “too successful” and crowding out private payment solutions and financial intermediation, or being “not successful enough” and generating insufficient demand. We take both risks seriously.  To avoid interfering with the functioning of the financial system, we are considering how to make the digital euro a convenient medium of exchange but not an attractive form of investment. We are examining the pros and cons of introducing a quantitative cap on digital euro holdings[29] or a tiered remuneration that would disincentivise excessive holdings.[30] We are analysing the potential impact on monetary policy. To ensure that our digital currency would be a convenient means of payment, we are working to make it available within private payment solutions, so that people would be able to use it easily wherever they can pay digitally. We aim to level the playing field by allowing intermediaries – including small ones – to offer innovative solutions to their customers. And we are considering how a digital euro could improve financial inclusion. We are interviewing focus groups to identify the characteristics of a digital euro that would add value for users. And we are working on the technical options to reconcile different objectives such as the right of individuals to confidentiality versus the public interest in guaranteeing the transparency required to counter illegal activities; or the benefits of allowing the digital euro to be widely used versus the need to safeguard financial intermediation.  We have launched several work streams: on the design choices that can guarantee confidentiality, on the prioritisation of different use cases,[31] and on the business options for intermediaries[32]. We will cover areas such as cyber security and operational resilience.  We are interacting with all relevant stakeholders, from intermediaries to consumers, merchants and authorities. We are cooperating with the European Parliament, the European Commission and the finance ministers of the euro area countries. To get technical advice and collect a broad range of views on possible solutions, we have set up a Market Advisory Group[33] and are regularly discussing the project with the Euro Retail Payments Board[34], academics and think tanks. Bearing in mind the international implications of CBDCs,[35] we are cooperating with other major central banks. In October 2021 we launched a two-year investigation phase to define the design features of the digital currency. At the end of 2023 we could decide to start a realisation phase to develop and test the appropriate technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to provide a digital euro, which could take three years. Only thereafter will we decide whether to actually issue a digital euro.  Conclusion Let me conclude.  For decades, the complementarity of public money and private money has guaranteed stability, competition and innovation.  The digitalisation of payments cannot be ignored by central banks, which have so far provided their money only in physical form. Central banks cannot escape these transformations, nor should they underestimate the potential for far-reaching shifts that may occur.  To ensure that public money maintains its fundamental role in the digital age, the ECB has launched an investigation into the possible issuance of a digital euro alongside cash.  The digital euro is an ambitious and complex project that can improve the efficiency of the economic and financial system. We want to make it a driver of stability and inclusive progress, capable of strengthening ties between economies and financial systems around the world. Our experience may provide useful insights for other central banks. And likewise, we are keen to learn from them. I am therefore pleased to exchange views with US experts, and I am now looking forward to our discussion.    Although central bank money can also take the form of reserves (deposits that commercial banks hold at the central bank), the focus of this speech will be on cash. One-to-one convertibility with central bank money is what makes the regulated forms of money convertible with each other and is why they are perceived as interchangeable when making payments. This does not mean that the safeguards put in place to protect savings – legislation and banking supervision, deposit insurance schemes, capital markets supervision – are not important. On the contrary. They must, however, be flanked by convertibility to ensure the smooth functioning of payments and the stability of the financial system.

For instance, the notes of new banks were more heavily discounted. See Gorton, G. (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 104, No 2, pp. 346-397. Price variability was inconvenient, as users had to consult a note reporter to monitor the value of the notes in circulation. See Eichengreen, B. (2019), “From Commodity to Fiat and Now to Crypto: What Does History Tell Us?”, NBER Working Paper Series, No 25426, January. The experience of the free banking era in the United States varied considerably among states and each had a significant number of problem banks. See Rolnick, A.J. and Weber, W.E. (1983), “New Evidence on the Free Banking Era”, American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No 5, pp. 1080-1091. In the United States, dominant banks disciplined note issuing banks by threatening them with bulk redemption of their notes, while clearinghouses regulated member bank levels of equity, reserves, and interest rates, audited members, produced money during crises and issued a form of insurance; See Gorton, G. (1985), “Banking theory and free banking history: A Review Essay”, Journal of Monetary Economics, 16(2), 267-276. See Bank for International Settlements (2003), op. cit.

While banks could continue to hold central bank money in the form of reserves, this may not prove sufficient to fully preserve the monetary anchor role of central bank money. People would be unable to use central bank money as means of exchange and would thus have little incentive to hold it. This would weaken the unit of account role of sovereign money. If the currency is not demanded by the public, the mere announcement that the central bank would make it available would not be enough to preserve its role in the economy. In history, sovereign money was at times used as unit of account but not as a medium of exchange. This was for example the case of the livre, the “imaginary money” introduced by Charlemagne in the monetary reform of the eighth century, named after the libra (pound), the sovereign money introduced by the ancient King of Rome Servius Tullius in the sixth century BC. The livre was never coined and never circulated. However, it had a fixed conversion rate with another form of sovereign money, the denier (1 livre was equal to 240 deniers), which was actually coined and actively used as means of exchange.

The value of a stablecoin is linked to a portfolio of one or more other assets (the reserve assets), including currency in the form of commercial bank deposits. Stablecoins can therefore be low-risk but not risk-free. Risks increase if stablecoin arrangements are backed by risky or opaque assets, especially in times of market turmoil.

New players, including operating platforms with huge customer bases, can exploit network effects and economies of scale to build dominant positions, creating their own closed-loop ecosystems. They may exploit customer data for private scoring and other uses. They may erect barriers to impede interoperability and use their “coins” to displace other forms of money.

While the international role of a currency will continue to depend to a large extent on the fundamentals of the underlying economy, availability in CBDC form would facilitate use in cross-border payments by reducing frictions and costs. Model simulations suggest that the share of a country’s currency in global export payments increases when it is available as a CBDC, but continues to depend to a large extent on forces such as the size and the stability of the economy and the development and efficiency of the financial sector.

In the public consultation conducted by the ECB in 2020, 43% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of a digital euro, well ahead of other features. The other characteristics highlighted in the consultation were the security of payments and usability throughout the euro area, which were ranked first by 18% and 11% of those surveyed, respectively.

Based on the Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE), the preference for cash in the euro area is significantly higher among low-income respondents. While only 36% of those with an income of €1,000 per month or less have a preference for cards or other cashless means of payment, that preference was expressed by 61% in the income bracket of €2,500 and more.

Although they are often invisible to the customer, the various layers of merchant fees can add up to some 3% of the transaction value. According to Glory Global Solutions, “Some banks tell merchants to budget for between 2.5% and 3% of the transaction valuable, but with so many variables, this is only ever a rough guide.” See Glory Global Solutions (2018),  Electronic Payments – Not As Cheap As You Think . In the United States, 6% of adults do not have a checking, savings, or money market account. See Federal Reserve (2019),  Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2018 - May 2019 . In the euro area there are still more than 5% of adults without a payment account. See World Bank (2017),  Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database  .  In the case of quantitative holding limits, we are considering waterfall solutions linking digital euro accounts to private money accounts, to allow payments in excess of the limit. Bindseil, U.

Use cases refer to the various interactions between people, businesses, Government and machines (e.g. payments at the point of sale, online, peer-to-peer, machine-to-machine, etc.). Business options are naturally related to costs (fees, devices), but can also include the front end, taking into account consumers’ preference to use the current payment methods, be it their smartphone, card or cash. A digital euro should provide a similar payment experience, while also considering future innovations like QR codes, which are becoming more and more popular.

       "6    SPEECH  Towards an immersive supervisory approach to the management of climate-related and environmental risks in the banking sector   Keynote speech by Frank Elderson, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Industry outreach on the thematic review on climate-related and environmental risks  Frankfurt am Main, 18 February 2022 Welcome to this industry outreach event organised by ECB Banking Supervision on the management and supervision of climate-related and environmental risks, or C&E risks for short. Our focus today is the current state of C&E risk management practices in the banking sector, and the ECB’s upcoming thematic review of these risks. Over the last couple of years, we have launched several targeted actions in this direction. In 2020 we issued the ECB guide on C&E risks and in 2021 we conducted a supervisory review of banks’ approaches to managing these risks based on their own assessments. The ECB has progressively taken C&E risks into greater account in its supervision, as have banks in their business.  2022 will be the year that C&E risks become integrated in the day-to-day activities of our joint supervisory teams, who are in constant contact with banks. These risks will come to form an integral part of our ongoing dialogue with supervised entities and the supervisory review and evaluation process, the SREP. This will ultimately influence banks’ minimum capital requirements. The encompassing and integrated approach – which supervisors and banks are already very familiar with for traditional risk categories – is what I call the immersive supervisory approach to C&E risks. Along with the 2022 ECB supervisory stress test, the thematic review forms part of the ECB Banking Supervision roadmap to ensure that banks adequately incorporate C&E risk management. These supervisory activities complement the ECB’s broader C&E agenda, which includes publishing the results of an economy-wide climate change stress test, and our 2021 action plan to include climate change considerations in our monetary policy. The state of C&E risk management  Climate and environmental risks are impossible to avoid. The public knows it and the ECB knows it. The banks themselves now know it, as reflected in the outcome of their internal assessments. All banks that thoroughly assessed their exposure to C&E risks concluded that these risks are material. By contrast, not a single materiality assessment submitted by banks that reported no material risk exposure was deemed adequate. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the banks that acknowledged the materiality of the C&E risks they faced did so for both transition and physical risks. And they acknowledged that these risks are material in both the short and the long term. Despite this broad acknowledgement of the materiality of these risks, and thus the need to adequately manage them, we see that most banks still have a considerable way to go in developing their risk management capabilities. As the findings we published last year show, banks reported that 90% of their practices are only partially or not at all in line with ECB supervisory expectations. Let me repeat: 90%. This is both bad news and good news. Bad news because, at the time of their assessment, banks were a long way away from where they needed to be. But good news because half the banks we supervise already acknowledge that climate risks are an inevitable part of their day-to-day business. We therefore expect banks to analyse how C&E risks can or will affect their portfolios and products over the short, medium and long term, and under various scenarios, too. This type of forward-looking analysis of C&E risk should be basic practice, just as it would be for any other type of risk. Moreover, beyond merely formally attributing responsibilities, we still see banks making little progress towards more actively managing the C&E risks they face. Even certain banks that recognise the materiality of C&E risks have not reported any practices to either reduce or manage their level of risk. This year we want to see firm progress in how banks incorporate C&E risks in their risk management. In doing so, banks should adopt a strategic approach to managing these risks, using the full array of the risk management instruments at their disposal. This includes strategically realigning portfolios, setting clear risk appetites, developing mitigation strategies, adjusting qualitative credit criteria and quantifying and holding capital. Another key area in which banks can make progress is by actively supporting their clients in mitigating and adapting to the different types of climate and environmental risks. Moreover, banks can draw on the industry’s good practices that we shared last year in our report. In the face of data challenges and methodological uncertainties, banks have an even stronger imperative to get moving. To be clear, banks should not misconstrue the ECB’s actions as an outright call for divesting from carbon-intensive activities or from geographical regions vulnerable to physical risk. Rather, we are asking banks to fully grasp the physical and transition risks and to actively start managing them, with the aim of making their portfolios more resilient to C&E risks. Not all sectors will decarbonise overnight. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios show that certain sectors will continue to rely on carbon-intensive technologies for some time. We as prudential supervisors merely need banks to understand what the transition entails for their risk exposures to those sectors, and to reflect it in their overall risk management strategy. What we do not expect is an outright withdrawal from carbon-intensive industries, nor do we expect it to happen for every single sector or counterparty – but we do expect banks to harbour the capacity to manage the risks emerging from climate change. To draw a comparison with traditional risk exposures, we, as supervisors, would of course not expect banks to divest from all assets that entail credit risks, but we do insist that these risks are managed appropriately. C&E risks are to be managed just like any other risk; and their sound management requires sound risk controls. This is precisely one of our focus areas in the upcoming thematic review on C&E risks. Supervisory roadmap for C&E risks For several years, the ECB has identified banks’ exposure to C&E risks as one of the main vulnerabilities in the European banking sector. Assessing and helping banks address risks stemming from climate change and environmental degradation will be one of our supervisory priorities from now until 2024, albeit these risks have been on our minds for far longer. I remember giving my first speeches on this topic in late 2015 when still an executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank. So, we have already come a long way and our supervision of C&E risks will now take more concrete form. The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&E risks.  The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the banks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front.  The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C&E risks, which is a key topic of the session today. Two years after we launched the supervisory guide on C&E risks, we are conducting this thematic review to follow up on the self-assessment exercise conducted last year. Our main goal will be to assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks’ C&E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C&E risk strategies and risk profiles. Do all banks’ processes and analyses have visible consequences? Does the way in which banks actually steer their balance sheets and risk profiles reflect the materiality of C&E risks? These will be some of the core questions of this review.  As part of this exercise, we will monitor banks’ alignment with the supervisory expectations set out in the guide, and encourage banks’ progress towards the industry’s best practices. Fortunately, those practices were identified across different European banks over the last two years. They show that some banks are already doing what we are asking. The ECB is doing its part by guiding banks in their climate journey, setting forth supervisory expectations and sharing updates on good practices in the industry. In light of the efforts banks have already made in devising their action plans, as well as all the information on this topic published to date – by both the ECB and several other public and private organisations we expect to see material progress in banks’ implementation deadlines and concrete actions.  As part of the thematic review, we will also be looking more closely at the risk management practices for environmental risks such as risks to biodiversity, water stress and pollution. All have similar features and warrant a coordinated approach. Banks can make significant savings if, taking advantage of the momentum, they extend the range of their preparations to cover all these risks, and are thus ready for a new, more concrete, supervisory and regulatory environment. Our benchmark from last year shows that, as of early 2021, very few banks were looking into environmental risks beyond climate. We have highlighted this gap to banks. This year, we will assess how banks are managing their exposures to environmental risks beyond climate and follow up accordingly.  As we build our joint supervisory teams’ capacity to help banks understand and incorporate C&E risks, our supervisors will treat these risks just like any other. Last year’s review was conducted by a central team of experts, with the joint supervisory teams conducting the follow-up dialogue with the bank. By contrast, this thematic review will be fully embedded in the work of every joint supervisory team. While still backed by a central team of experts, the review will be driven from the engine room of supervision. And this is where the supervision of C&E risks will stay. Following up on the thematic review, all banks under our direct supervision will receive comprehensive feedback setting out any shortcomings identified. Combined with the observations from the climate stress test, this will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. Targeted qualitative requirements may also be imposed. As part of the review, we will also carefully check whether banks have followed up on any requirements we issued last year. The thematic review is a full-on supervisory review. As such, we also have the full set of supervisory measures at our disposal to address shortcomings. Those banks that continue to fail to conduct a materiality assessment of C&E risks or have not followed-up on earlier requirements will start noticing just that. Regulatory and supervisory framework  The ECB is taking action under its mandate and under the current prudential framework to get banks to where they need to be in terms of incorporating C&E risks into their business. Our supervisory activities are thus keeping in line with the rapidly evolving regulatory and supervisory framework.  For example, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive proposed by the European Commission will further articulate the integration of C&E risks in the legal framework and will require banks to develop transition plans and supervisors to scrutinise them. This is the next important step in risk management, which I have mentioned on previous occasions, and which will require banks to look thirty years ahead and devise intermediate targets for their risk exposures that can render their risk management practices fit for an economy that will transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.  And finally, disclosure frameworks and taxonomies are also developing rapidly to create an information architecture to enable banks to manage the risks and scale up green finance. Both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Banking Authority (EBA) have intensive work programmes to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework can better cater for climate-related risks. One concrete example is the EBA’s recently published implementing technical standards for the disclosure of Environmental Social and Governance risks, which also require large banks to start disclosing their alignment with the IEA pathways by June 2024 at the latest for all relevant portfolios. Banks are running out of time to complete their preparations. On all these fronts, the sooner banks act, the smoother the transition will be for them, and for the economy they help support.  Conclusion  For ECB Banking Supervision, 2022 marks the third year of dedicated C&E risk activities. First, we issued our guide with supervisory expectations. Next, we asked banks to share with us their self-assessments on how their practices match our expectations. And they have indeed been very open and candid in these self-assessments, for which I am truly grateful.  Together we have learnt that there is a lot of room for improvement. Considering the importance, urgency and long-lasting nature of climate change, we are asking banks to intensify their efforts in measuring and managing C&E risks in line with our expectations. With the exercises that we are conducting this year, the prudential supervision of climate-related risks is moving closer to maturity. The thematic review is the next step in fully immersing C&E risks in the work of the joint supervisory teams and marks key progress towards their integration in the SREP. It crystalises our commitment to ensuring that the prudential supervision of C&E risks is here to stay.


